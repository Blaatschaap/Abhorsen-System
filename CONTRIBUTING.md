# Contributing

Feel free to contribute by posting issues (or  even better, pull requests). If you are unsure what you would like to contribute, check out the list below! Contributions can be directly in the Homebrewery format, or just as raw text and I will work it into the pdf version.

## What I currently would love contributions on

* Monster art (do keep in mind that you need to have all the rights/permissions to use these)
* More Monsters
* Class/subclass introductions, explaining their role in the world
* Custom Abhorsen themed Backgrounds
