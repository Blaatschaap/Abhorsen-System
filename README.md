# Abhorsen OGL 5e Conversion Mod (Alpha)

A Abhorsen themed 5e total conversion mod. All existing 5e classes have been replaced with new content, base skills such as DEX and WIS have been redone and races have been removed. All classes now have access to the Stamina System and there is a new bestiary to explore filled with abhorsen themed monsters.

## How to use

Download the latest PDF version to read more about the system.  

### Character sheet

A fillable character sheet is provided. Given the system is still very much in development, the character sheet is also work in progress and may contain elements used in older version, but no longer valid. When in doubt, the pdf is leading.

### PHB.txt

This is the raw format of the pdf. Unless you are planning on contributing, this can be ignored.

# Contributing

Feel free to contribute by posting issues (or  even better, pull requests). If you are unsure what you would like to contribute, check out the list below! Contributions can be directly in the Homebrewery format, or just as raw text and I will work it into the pdf version.

## What I currently would love contributions on

* Monster art (do keep in mind that you need to have all the rights/permissions to use these)
* More Monsters
* Custom Abhorsen themed Backgrounds
