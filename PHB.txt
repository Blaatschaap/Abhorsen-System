# World setting
:
The setting is focussed on the country The Old Kingdom and its neighbours. The Old Kingdom landscape resembles modern day Scotland, with lots of mountains and lakes. To the north are the steppes, populated by tribal barbarians. To the west is a vast desert with few oasis', while on the east there is the ocean. On the south is the country of Ancelstierre, with a massive wall on its border. Whilst the Old Kingdom and its northern neighbours have magic and feudal technology, Ancelstierre only has 1910's technology with magic only being available near the border with the Old Kingdom.

## The Old Kingdom
The Old Kingdom is a rugged land, sparsely populated and a low life expectancy. In the good times there is a standing army, with a ruler patrolling the land and protecting its inhabitants from the constant threat of the Undying. In the bad times, the villagers will have to fend for themselves. Towns are often close to peninsulas or islands, given the Undying cannot easily cross running water. Travelling is done in groups, sometimes accompanied by a charter mage to protect the merchants and other travellers. Time passes slower in the Old Kingdom, compared to other lands, resulting in 26-hour days. 

### Charter Religion
Apart from being a source of magic, the Charter is also a form of religion. The common folk tend to refer to the Charter as an omnipotent collection that protects them and grant the pious benefits. Powerful Charter Magic users are akin to priests. A fair amount of the population can use very minor Charter Magic, for example to light a fire. These people are held in high regard and tend to hold roles such as mayor.

The Charter is also referred to as the Pact of the Seven Bright Shiners.

:::::::::::::::::::

### Rulers
The Old Kingdom is a monarchy, with the king in charge of the military arm of the country while the queen takes care of the rest. 

Their rule is hereditary. The first son or daughter is considered to be king- or queen-in-waiting. He/she will become the new ruler together with a partner chosen by him/her. This partner cannot be part of the royal line but must have an unsullied charter mark.



#### Abhorsen
This job title granted by the rulers of the Old Kingdom. The Abhorsen is tasked with keeping the Undying under control and sending them beyond the seventh gate. The Abhorsen tends to be a very gifted and strong Charter mage is picked who can also use Free Magic. This title can be held by one of the rulers should they be able to but is generally given to others.

The Abhorsen will prefer to have several Abhorsen-in-waiting, as apprentices. The Abhorsen and his students have access to both Charter Magic and Free Magic and can therefore use all magic bells.

#### The Clayr
The Clayr are an oracular group composed almost exclusively of women, who live in a snowy mountain called the Clayr's Glacier, in the northern part of the Old Kingdom. They are all related and possess nut-brown skin, pale blond hair, and eyes of blue or green. The Glacier is also home to the Great Library of the Clayr, which contains a variety of treasures, monsters, and rarities in addition to books. Due to the Clayr's precognitive Sight, within the Great Library, there are often rooms created for events which unfold decades or centuries later. 

### Towns
Most towns in the Old Kingdom will have walls to protect against the Undying. Villagers are often left to fend for themselves and are therefore generally quite close knit with a healthy dose of scepticism for outsiders.

### Ancelstierre Technology
Most advanced technology does not play nicely with the Charter within the Old Kingdom. Cars will breakdown with welds coming apart and paint disintegrating into raw components. Machine fabricated clothes and paper will be reduced to scraps and rags. Guns will refuse to function, and grenades will not explode.

## The Old Kingdom History
In a time long past, chaotic magic creatures roamed free in the Old Kingdom. Of these creatures, nine were far more powerful than the other, as well as immortal. These nine creatures became known as the Nine Bright Shiners. They feuded with each other and kept their own agenda. 

One of the Bright Shiners, named Orannis, was tired of the endless struggle and sought to end it, by attempting to reduce every living creature to an Undying creature under his control. The other Bright Shiners learned of his plan and banded together, with seven bright shiners forming a pact named the Charter. The goal of the Charter was to permanently bind Orannis and seal away his influence over the Undying. Yrael, the remaining Bright shiner not in the Charter, initially promised aid for binding Orannis, but backed out in the end, attempting to remain neutral. Without Yraels help though, only a partial binding was achieved. The Charter managed to split Orannis in two, binding him in eternal sleep until his two halves are reformed. 

Orannis' influence lingered however, with his Undying reduced to mindless zombies, perpetually hungry for Life. His followers also remained, necromancers controlling the Undying for their own wicked gains. To curb the necromancers, the Charter created a river in the realm of Death, attempting to flush any Undying out of existence. This divided Death up in seven precincts, with each Bright Shiner attempting to push the Undying lower and lower into the realm of Death, until they are banished from existence. 

These acts severely weakened the Bright Shiners of the Charter, but the land was not yet safe, with necromancers still managing to reanimate the Undying. Yrael also still roamed free, having betrayed the Charter. The Charter banded together again and punished Yrael, forcing him to forever serve the bloodline of the Abhorsen, until the Abhorsen thought his sentence finished. In a final act of desperation to prevent Orannis' corruption of the world, the Bright Shiners dissolved parts of their being in order to contain Orannis. Each would lend their power to the people, forming what is now known as Charter Magic. Each would also grant specific boons to the people. Five of them fully surrendered their bodies and formed the five Great Charter stones.

<div style='margin-top:140px'></div>

Two of them worked together on their boon, transforming into the Wall, a massive structure between what is now the Old Kingdom and Ancelstierre, containing the magic and preventing it from going spreading to the south.
One gave their blessing to a bloodline, intending them to rule the land and protect its people from the followers of Orannis. This bloodline became the kings and queens of the Old Kingdom.
One of them blessed the bloodline of what is now known as the Abhorsens, granting them power to hunt down the followers of Orannis and their Undying.
One of them imbued the denizens of the Glacier, granting them the ability to predict the future, so they could warn the land.
It is not known what happened to the remaining two but given they did not form a Great Charter stone; it is believed they still roam the land in their diminished forms.

#### Knowledge of the history
Children infused with a Charter Mark living in the Old Kingdom naturally remember the following poem. Adults remember the poem exists, but its knowledge of its content will disappear from memory gradually over an hour after hearing or reading it.

{{note 
<div style='text-align:center;'>
#### The Nine Bright Shiners
I'll sing you a song of the long ago.  
Seven shine the Shiners, oh!  
What did the Seven do way back when?  
Why, they wove the Charter then!  
Five for the warp, from beginning to end.  
Two for the woof, to make and mend.  
That's the Seven, but what of the Nine—  
What of the two that chose not to shine?  
The Eighth did hide, hide all away,  
But the Seven caught him and made him pay.  
The Ninth was strong and fought with might,  
But lone Orannis was put out of the light,  
Broken in two and buried under hill,  
Forever to lie there wishing us ill.

## Ancelstierre
Ancelstierre is culturally and technologically based on pre-WWI Britain. There are boarding schools, biplanes and most of the long-distance communication is based upon radio. Cars exist but are somewhat rare and expensive. Most roads are made for carts and not for cars.

Ancelstierre is quite large and generally at war with its southern neighbours. The military plays a big role in the political landscape, but is beholden to the politicians.

Most southern consider magic a myth and will generally look down upon northern Ancelstierriens who actually deal with free and charter magic on a daily basis. Because of this, most army recruits coming from the south get a rude awakening if they are stationed in or near the Perimeter.

### The Wall
The Wall was created by two of the Bright Shiners from the Charter and separates Ancelstierre and the Old Kingdom. The Wall is a vast 30 ft high earthen wall stretching from coast to coast, looking akin to large dunes. The wall was made to protect other areas from the Undying and Orannis. The Undying cannot cross the Wall without sustaining damage or weakening them. This does not stop them from constantly trying to cross into Ancelstierre, where life is in abundance and poorly defended.

#### Crossing points
Over the years, several crossing points have been made in the wall. At these crossings the Wall is lowered to allow for easier trade. Because of this, the protections against the Undying are also lower here, making it a preferred place of entry for the Undying and their allies. Nowadays, all crossing points have guards on the Ancelstierre side of the wall in order to protect northern Ancelstierre.

::::::::::::::::::::::

### The Perimeter
The Perimeter is a roughly 20-mile-wide strip of land on the Ancelstierre side of the wall. There is a heavy presence of military in this area. Due to the closeness to the wall, magic will generally work here, and technology will often fail. There is no radio contact possible if fierce winds are blowing from the Old Kingdom. 

The dead can generally survive in the Perimeter but may combust if out during a bright day. Free and Charter magic will work in this area but will fail the further from the wall it is used.

#### The Wall Garrison
The garrison tasked with securing the border is named the Wall Garrison. The Wall Garrison finds itself in a precarious position. It has an exceedingly high death rate under new recruits due to constant attacks from the Undying, but any reports about the Undying are dismissed as superstition by the generals down south. Their guns and trucks are prone to failure based on proximity to the wall. Therefore, most soldiers who survive their initial confrontations with the Undying, will arm themselves with swords and bows. This is done out of pocket, given that any requests for issued medieval weaponry is denied by the capital.

Northern Ancelstierriens who have a knack for Charter or Free Magic will generally be put in small patrol groups spread throughout the Perimeter. If Undying are found attacking the wall, they will be called to save the regular soldiers.

#### Prohibited Zone
The Prohibited Zone is the area directly bordering the Wall and is filled with hand forged barbed wire and trenches. Due to the Undying commonly looking fairly human until they start attacking, it is hard to decipher if a person is human or Undying. Therefore, the Wall Garrison has the policy to shoot any trespassers who cannot quickly identify themselves and have a permit to be near the wall. 


##### Prohibited zone border

## Magic
In the Old Kingdom, magic takes two forms: Free Magic or Charter Magic. The former is older, and natural in origin, whereas the latter is imposed as an assurance of order, by the immortal 'Seven Bright Shiners'. 

Some Free Magic remains in the world, in various breeds of monsters and certain magic users. 

The Charter is described as an "endless flow" of symbols describing the cosmos; each used by magicians to achieve psycho kinesis. The composition of spells ranges from single Charter marks to long series requiring a 'master mark' and sometimes a physical focus (typically a sword or wand). 

Though Free Magic is 'corrosive' to living things and Charter Magic, Free Magic spells are required to pass the Gates of Death, and the calls of the bells are Free Magic spells subject to the Charter. Although the Abhorsen may use Free Magic without suffering long-term ill effects, typical Free Magic users are ultimately "devoured by the Free Magic they profess to master". Practitioners of Charter Magic have a Charter Mark drawn on their forehead at birth or later in life. Marks unsullied by Free Magic are used to identify true Charter Mages (as opposed to Free Magic sorcerers or constructs in disguise). Charter marks become invisible if you get too far from the Old Kingdom (roughly 75 miles). Most inhabitants of the Old Kingdom and northern Ancelstierre will have one. 

### The Five Great Charters

{{note 
<div style='text-align:center;'>
#### The Five Great Charters rhyme
*Five Great Charters knit the land.*  
*Together linked, hand in hand.*  
*One in the people who wear the Crown.*  
*Two in the folk who keep the Undying down.*  
*Three and Five became stone and mortar.*  
*Four sees all in frozen water.*
</div>
}}

This rhyme dictates that at some point in history the Five Great Charters were concentrated in physical objects, or human bloodlines. The bloodlines are those of the royals, the Abhorsen, the Clayr, and the Wallmakers. After this, the entire Wallmaker line physically became the Great Charter Stones and the Wall that separates the Old Kingdom from Ancelstierre, to prevent contamination of their descent. The Great Charter Stones are located in an underground reservoir in the Old Kingdom's capital, Belisaere, and are the sources of Charter Magic in the Old Kingdom. Under the influence of the Wall, magic, both Free and Charter, exists only in the Old Kingdom; but can be practised in northern Ancelstierre, and further south if there is a strong wind from the Old Kingdom. 

<div style='margin-top:140px'></div>

### Charter stones
Charter Stones are large stone monuments "with Charter marks running like quicksilver through the stone, forming and dissolving, only to reform again, in a never-ending story that told of the making of the world." They serve as an easy access point to the Charter for Charter mages, and suppress the Undying and any entrance to Death, but can be broken by Free Magic sorcerers with the use of the blood of a Charter mage. They can be mended by strong charter mages, using blood from a family line unsullied by free magic. The royal line is the most famous of these bloodlines, but others also exist within the Old Kingdom.

The Charter stones were originally created by the Wallmakers. There are many Charter Stones throughout the Old Kingdom that strengthen the presence of the Charter.

### The Bells

The bells of power are seven eponymous bells typically used by magic users to control the Undying, named after the Seven Bright Shiners who invested themselves in the Charter. Each bell has a specific power over the Undying and Free Magic creatures, and if used by a skilled magic user, also on living people. An errant or improper ring can affect the caster instead of the target, or cause other adverse effects. From smallest to largest they are:

##### Bells
| Bell 			| Nickname| Description 																																												|
|:----------|:-------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| **Ranna**			| *Sleeper*	| Prompts drowsiness in the auditor																															|
| **Mosrael**		| *Waker*		| Transmit the ringer further into Death but the auditor into Life               								|
| **Kibeth**		| *Walker*	| Grants the Undying freedom of movement or force them to walk according to the ringer's intention |
| **Dyrim**			| *Speaker*	| Either revive or annul the hearer's ability to speak  													              |
| **Belgaer**		| *Thinker*	| Restore or remove memory                																											|
| **Saraneth**	| *Binder*	| Control the Undying directly                																											|
| **Astarael**	| *Weeper*	| Send both ringer and auditor far into Death                																		|

### Bell bandoliers
People wearing bell bandoliers are generally considered suspicious by common folk. Unless directly associated to the Abhorsen, bandolier carriers could very well be necromancers looking for fresh Undying to collect.

## Creatures
Strictly speaking, there are five basic supernatural creatures in the Abhorsen world:

### The Undying
The Undying are ghosts with both the inclination and the ability to resist the river of Death, who re-enter the world of Life. Though a rare few emerge into Life on their own power, most must be summoned by a necromancer or emerge near a broken Charter Stone (where the Charter's influence has been severely diminished, creating a "door into Death"), or where many deaths have recently occurred. All Undying are averse to running water, and most are unable to withstand direct sunlight.

There are three classes of Undying: Lesser, Medium and Greater. The Greater Undying are usually represented by Undying from beyond the Fifth Gate (spirits from the deeper realms of Death and correspondingly more powerful). Greater Undying, such as Fifth-Gate Resters or Thralks, may exist in Life without a physical body (making them much more difficult to destroy).

The name of Lesser Undying refers to Undying Hands, Ghlims and Gore Crows: a range of re-embodied spirits often used by necromancers as weapons. Lesser Undying may be incapacitated by immersing them in running water or by destroying their physical bodies with Charter Magic or explosives. Most Undying prey on the living to remain in Life.

### Constructs
Free Magic constructs are forms assumed by Free Magic elementals or powerful Undying spirits. Though such constructs may be destroyed, destroying the Elemental itself is much more difficult and typically the province of Free Magic.

### Mordicants
These are fiery constructs of clay and blood, animated by Free Magic and guided by a Greater Undying or Free magic user, able to move between Life and Death at will. They are fierce combatants, and seem to have enhanced senses, able to track specific targets over hundreds of miles, resisting direct sunlight to do so.

<div style='margin-top:240px'></div>

### Free Magic Elementals
These are free-willed beings wholly composed of Free Magic. The most common elementals belong to specific "breeds" (such as Stilken, Magrue, Jerreq, or Hish), while the most powerful are unique, or "of a singular nature". Though "many thousands" of Free Magic Elementals escaped the creation of the Charter, most were later imprisoned or enslaved by it. Of the remainder, "no truly dangerous creature of Free Magic has woken in a thousand years, save to the sound of Mosrael and Saraneth, or by a direct summons using their secret names". Some cannot be destroyed except by a Free Magic sorcerer more powerful than they, or by immersion in running water (though Free Magic creatures of the Third Kindred, or those infused with the essence of the Nine, are exempt from this rule). Charter Magic is typically ineffective.

### Charter Sendings
Charter Sendings are servants or sentries constructed entirely of Charter Marks. Many may only act within a given function, which can be of indefinite complexity. Apart from certain fixtures (such as a surcoat or insignia), Charter Sendings do not possess a concrete physical shape, and derive identity primarily from their function. They are capable of emotive response, but show little desire except to fulfil their mandates.

## Death

Death consists of Seven Precincts divided by Seven Gates, through which a grey river flows. Almost everything in Death is a bleak grey, and a subtle grey fogginess limits visibility. The river may also contain and conceal hostile dead beings, which attack living travellers. Free Magic users can cross the boundary at will. Undying spirits can cross only when aided by a Necromancer, or when the border is weakened by a concentration of (often violent) deaths. Dexterity and great willpower are required to resist the current, which is psychological as well as physical. Each gate responds to a Free Magic spell wielded by Abhorsens and Free Magic users; Undying cannot pass any Gate unless they are very powerful. Each Precinct contains a different peril.


#### First Precinct
The First Precinct is mostly knee-deep water, but has eddies and pools dangerous to the interloper. Its Gate is a huge waterfall.

#### Second Precinct
The Second Precinct has pitfalls throughout its domain and low visibility; The Gate is a vertical river rising from the floor.

#### Third Precinct
The Third Precinct has slightly warmer ankle-deep water and visibility is slightly improved. Periodic, irresistible waves carry dead creatures through the Gate (a wall of mist), often beyond the final Seventh Gate.

#### Fourth Precinct
The Fourth Precinct has a low concentration of Undying, as most of those who reach it have been stunned by the Third Precinct's waves, and are carried easily to the dangerous and deceptively short waterfall that comprises its Gate.

\column

#### Fifth Precinct
The Fifth Precinct is too deep to wade, and must be crossed by a thin black bridge that frequently attracts dead creatures. The water in the Fifth Precinct has strong mutagenic properties, and is implied to be partially responsible for the monstrous appearance of some Greater Undying and necromancers. Its Gate is a whirlpool. 

#### Sixth Precinct
The Sixth Precinct has no current, and its water is present as a shallow pool. There are many Undying creatures in this Precinct, some of whom are Greater Undying. The Gate has no substance and can appear anywhere, but appears as a lift bordered by a cylinder of water.

#### Seventh Precinct
The Seventh Precinct is an endless pool of deep, still and clear water. It is warmer than the other precincts and there is no fog, allowing a necromancer to see in every direction. The Seventh Gate, resembling a starry sky, confirms the final death of any who look upon it, except those to who retain a native span of years. Those claimed by the Gate rise at varying speeds and vanish, never to return.

}}
:::::
### Dual Skill Checks
Skill checks, hit checks and saving throws will use a d20 as used in 5e.
Skill checks will consist of using the modifiers of two ability scores. This can be two of the same modifiers. For example, if the player has to carry a heavy object a fair distance, the GM could ask you to roll a d20 and add your Strength and Constitution modifiers. But if it was simply lifting a very heavy boulder, it might require a Strength + Strength check, known as a double Strength check.

#### Saving throws

There are three categories of saving throws, Physical, Charter and Death saving throws. Death saving throws will be discussed in the Death chapter. Both Physical and Charter saving throws will consist of a list of 5 ability score saving throws, namely Strength, Agility, Constitution, Intelligence and Charisma. Your Reflexes modifier will be added to each Physical saving throw and your Aptitude modifier will be added to the Charter saving throws.

For instance, if you have the following base modifiers: Strength +2, Agility +1, Reflexes +3, Constitution +0, Intelligence +0, Charisma +1 and Aptitude -1, your saving throw tables will look as following (ignoring proficiencies). Having a very high Reflexes score results in very good Physical saving throws, but the lacking Aptitude score means that Charter saving throws will be rough for this character.

##### Example Saving throws modifiers
| Ability score | Base Value| Physical Saving | Charter Saving |
|:--------:|:--:|:-----:|:------:|
| Strength 		| +2| +5 | +1 |
| Agility 		| +1 | +4 | +0 |
| Reflexes 		| +3 | - | - |
| Constitution 	| +0 | +3 | -1 |
| Intelligence 	| +0 | +3 | -1 |
| Charisma 		| +1 | +4 | +0 |
| Aptitude    | -1 | - | - |

### Grappling

You can attempt to grapple a creature in melee range using a Strength + Agility skill check, contested by a either a Physical Strength saving throw or a Physical Agility saving throw of the target, targets choice. You cannot grapple a creature two sizes up from you and creatures two sizes down from you have advantage on Physical Agility saving throws.

### Shove
The shove attack will become a Strength + Strength contest opposed by a Strength + Agility or Strength + Reflexes skill check.

### Massive Damage
When a creature takes damage from a single source equal to or greater than half its hit point maximum, it must succeed on a DC 15 Physical Constitution saving throw or suffer a random effect determined by a roll on the System Shock table. For example, a creature that has a hit point maximum of 30, must make that Constitution save if it takes 15 damage or more from a single source.

##### System Shock
| d10 | Effect |
|:------:|:------:|
| 1  | The creature drops to 0 hit points |
| 2-3  | The creature drops to 1 hit points |
| 4-5 | The creature is stunned until the end of its next turn. |
| 6-7 | The creature can’t take reactions and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn. |
| 8-10 | The creature can’t take reactions until the end of its next turn. |

### Checking the Charter mark
Some creatures will have a Charter mark on their forehead. As an action you can check the Charter mark of a willing creature or a creature with speed 0. This will inform you whether they are considered Undying, a Free Magic creature or have any hiding in their bodies.

### Dazed Condition
Dazed is a new condition which will reduce your speed by half, will let you either perform an action or bonus action and you can't perform more than one melee or ranged attack during your turn. This also breaks concentration.


### Concentration
Concentration saving throws use Charter Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration.

<div style='margin-top:140px'></div>

### Getting up from prone
In addition to using up half your speed, getting up from prone will also provoke attacks of opportunity. You are considered prone for these attacks of opportunity.

### Flanking
When making a melee attack, you gain a +1 to all attack rolls if your opponent is threatened by a character or creature friendly to you on the opponent’s opposite border or opposite corner.

Only a creature or character that threatens the defender can help an attacker get a flanking bonus. Creatures with a reach of 0 feet can’t flank an opponent. 

### Jumping
Jumping works as 5e. However, do not forget that you need to spend a foot of movement for every foot of movement spent travelling through the air.

Any checks related to clearing obstacles use a DC 10 Strength + Agility skill check.

### Using potions
You can drink a potion as a bonus action, given the potion is already in your possession and reachable. 

You can spend an action to use a potion on a willing or unconscious creature. For this the potion must be reachable and not worn of carried by another creature. You can use this action to for instance feed a healing potion from your belt to an ally, or else to drink a potion left unsupervised on the counter. 

### Feats
A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides. At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once unless the feat's description says otherwise.

You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat's prerequisite, you can't use that feat until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Grappler fear requires you to have a Strength of 13 or higher. If your Strength is reduced below 13 somehow - perhaps by a withering curse - you can't benefit from the Grappler feat until your Strength is restored.

### Exert
Some Stamina abilities allow you to exert them. You will get a stronger effect, but the ability will cost double the amount of stamina.

\page

{{pageNumber,auto}}

### Changing Tactics
Some groups of features are marked as a tactic. These are mutually exclusive features where a choice will have to be made which of the features you want for your character.
It is possible to switch between tactics in an extended downtime during which a character studies, exchanges charter marks or realigns one’s psyche, as relevant for your character. This requires a long rest of at least 24 hours. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity—at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting Spells, or similar Adventuring activity—the characters must begin the rest again to change their tactic.

At the end, a character can change one of his or her tactics, as well as all the usual benefits from a long rest.

### Story time
Story time is what we call the time as the characters perceive it, from the perspective of being “in the story”—the amount of time it takes for them to accomplish any of the stuff you and the players say that they do during play. Most of the time, you’ll do this as an afterthought, mentioning it in passing (“Okay, so it takes you an hour to get back to the mayors house”) or mentioning it as part of a skill roll (“Cool, so after 20 minutes of sweeping the room, you find the following…”).

Under most circumstances, story time has no actual relation to real time. For example, a combat exchange might take a few minutes to play out in real time, but it only covers what happens in the first few seconds of a conflict. Likewise, you can cover long swaths of time simply by saying that it happens (“The contact takes two weeks to get back to you—are you doing anything while you wait, or can we just skip to the meeting?”). When used this way, it’s really just a convenience, a narrative device in order to add realism and some consistency to your story.

The length of a 'story time unit' will very heavily between scenes. Therefore, it is not always logical to use absolute values of time for certain game mechanics. The story you are trying to tell might lose a fair amount of its tension if you see somebody getting attacked 200 meters away if you know that person will be sent to Death and permanently have died by the time you can get there. This is why certain game mechanics where this is relevant will refer to Story Ticks instead of minutes or hours. This way, the same consistent rules can be used for somebody dying in combat and somebody wasting away from a disease.

{{note
##### Story Tick
A Story Tick is the unit of story time that passes in which all relevant PC's and NPC's get their actions in. The most obvious example is a round in combat, but it could also be the time it takes to perform a short rest.
}}

### Dying Condition
Dying is a new condition that will afflict you whenever you reach 0 hit points. Dying reduces your movement to 0 as well as leaving you Prone, Dazed and Blinded. You cannot regain hit points during your turn. The Dying condition ends the moment you regain any hit points, although you will likely still be Prone. If your hit points are reduced even further whilst afflicted by Dying, you will enter Death, ending the dying condition. If you do not regain hit points over your next two story ticks, you will also be sent to Death at the end of your turn.

If you gain the dying condition while in Death, you will are incapacitated and will be considered unstable.

Every playable character will have access to the Spare the Dying ability.

#### Spare the dying
::**Casting Time:** 1 action
::**Range** Touch 
::**Components** S
::**Duration** Instantaneous
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

Touch a willing other creature with the dying condition. Suspend the progression of dying story ticks. If a creature's dying story ticks has been suspended for 3 story ticks, they regain 1 hp after their turn ends.

### Using items without proficiency
You have disadvantage on any attacks or skill checks using items you are not proficient in.

### Alternate Initiative system
This is an optional alternative initiative system intended to make combat less dependent on individual initiatives. It goes as follows:

 - Every player rolls initiative as normal.
 - GM rolls initiative for monster with the highest initiative only.
 - Highest initiative goes first, as normal.
 - if a player went first, then the highest initiative monster goes second.  After that, the next highest initiative player, followed by the second highest initiative monster.  Battle alternates between a players turn and a monsters turn whenever possible.
 - If the monster won initiative, it goes first, then everything goes the same as the previous step.
 
 This system prevents stacks of monsters all acting at once and wiping out the party before they got to act, or vice versa. This removes a lot of randomness from the initiative order and to less one-sided battles, whilst still promoting a higher initiative score.

# Stamina
:
Every character has an amount of maximum stamina based upon their aptitude and constitution. They can use this stamina for special actions. Some of these special actions every character can do, some are bound to specific sub classes. 

However, the more stamina you use up, the weaker you will feel. You will gain penalties if you drop below certain thresholds, see the following table.

| Stamina Threshold | Effect |
|:------:|:------:|
| <50%  | -1 on all skill checks. -1 on all saving throws |
| <25%  | -3 on all skill checks. -2 on all saving throws |
| 0% | -3 on all skill checks. -2 on all saving throws. Disadvantage on all checks. |

## Regaining Stamina
You regain up to 50% of your maximum stamina rounded up on a short rest. You regain full stamina on a long rest.
:::
## Stamina moves


### Movement
Movement stamina moves cannot be performed whilst mounted.

#### Disengage -2 Stamina
You can spend 2 Stamina to be able to disengage as a bonus action.

#### Dash -2 Stamina
If you have not and will not use your action to dash this turn, you can spend 2 Stamina to be able to dash as a bonus action.

#### Standing Longjump -1 Stamina
By spending 1 Stamina you can double your jump distance for a **standing** longjump for this turn.

<div style='margin-top:340px'></div>

### Attacking

#### Shove -1 Stamina
When using a shove attack, you can spend 1 stamina to double the shove distance.

#### Pushing Attack -1 Stamina
When performing a basic melee attack on a creature of your size or smaller, you can spend 1 stamina to make it a pushing attack. If it hits, the target is not only dealt the damage of the blow, but is also pushed 5ft away from you.

#### Trip Attack -3 Stamina
When performing a basic attack on a creature of size Large or smaller, you can spend 3 stamina to make it a tripping attack. On a hit, the target makes a Physical Strength saving throw opposed by your DC. On a failed save, the target is knocked prone.

#### Jumping attack -1 Stamina
When performing a basic melee attack, you can spend 1 stamina to gain 5ft additional reach for that attack. You have disadvantage on this attack.

### Miscellaneous
#### Healing Surge -2 Stamina
As an action, you can spend a hit die and 2 stamina to gain half the value of the hit die + your Constitution  modifier.

#### Rally -2 Stamina
On your turn, you can use your bonus action and spend 2 stamina to bolster the resolve of one of your companions. When you do so, choose a creature that can see or hear you. That creature gains temporary hit points equal to your level + your Charisma modifier.

#### Reviving Shock -2* Stamina
As an action, you can give a willing creature with the dying condition you touch 1 hp. This ability will cost stamina equal to the level or CR of the creature. This will also inflict 1 exhaustion on the creature and make them dazed until the end of your next turn.

# Death
:
Whilst in or near the Old Kingdom, there is a dimension other than the physical world named Death. The physical realm is named Life. The souls of all creatures that die will find themselves drawn into Death. Death is a wet and gloomy place with seven layers, each with more and faster flowing water, but less light. The water will seep your strength and willpower in order to incapacitate you and take you deeper into Death. Where the first layer consists of a tame stream and puddles, the fifth layer is a massive whirlpool, ever flowing and pulling you towards the seventh layer. Between each layer there are barriers named gates. These vary from a small waterfall to the before mentioned whirlpool. It is possible to return from Death, but the deeper you are in Death, the harder it is. Beyond the seventh layer and its gate, lies true death. It is unknown what this entails, but nothing has ever returned from there.

#### Your body whilst in Death
Whilst your soul is within Death, your body will be encased in ice, incapacitating your body. You cannot move, perform actions or reactions and cannot gain hit points. Any attack on your body will automatically hit but cannot critically strike you. Your body will also automatically fail all Physical saving throws.

## Soul Decay
If your soul only spends a short period of time in Death and your body is still mostly intact, it is possible to return to your body without permanent effects. However, if your soul stays in Death for long periods of time on end, your soul will start to degrade. You will lose your personality traits and hunger more and more to taking the life of others. Eventually the hunger will overtake your senses and you will transform into one of the Undying. These are souls that simply refuse to stay dead and will seek ways of returning to Life.

Depending on your strength of will and your control of Free Magic, the decay will affect you differently. Most regular people will turn into mostly mindless beings simply named Dead Hands. But a perished necromancer might turn into a Mordicant.

If a decayed soul somehow finds a way back to Life, its body will generally look withered and might have black mists leaking from various cracks. Being transformed into the Undying will have various benefits and disadvantages. Most Undying have inhuman strength and can survive most wounds. On the downside, most Undying can be bound by Free Magic and might require deaths to occur near them to remain in Life.


<div style='margin-top:270px'></div>

## Entering Death
There are various ways of entering Death, some forced, some voluntary. You always enter Death at the first layer, but the velocity of entering Death can be very different depending on the method of entry.

### Hitting 0 hit points
If a creature drops to 0 hit points, that creature will gain the dying condition. If the creature still has the dying condition at the end of its turn two story ticks later, or receives more damage, the creature's soul will enter Death. 

Every Story Tick the creature will potentially fall deeper into Death. If the creature passes the seventh layer of Death, the creature body will no longer be encased in ice and cannot return. Entering Death without any hit points makes it very likely that you will pass the seventh gate without outside help.

### Free magic
If you are a Free magic user, you will have natural connection with the Death dimension. Some free magic users can freely move into Death without being reduced to zero hit points. This will reduce the pull of the water but will hardly make Death a safe space. The water can still drag you down and there could be Undying hunting you and trying to use you to return to Life.

### Artefacts
There are also artefacts that allow entrance to Death. The most common of these are the various bells magic users have, but there are also artefacts that do not require the user to have magical powers. This last category of artefact is very rare and sought after.

## Returning from Death
Once you enter Death through the dying condition and do not wish to pass the seventh gate, you will need to stabilize. This will be harder if your hit points are at 0 and near impossible if your body and most specifically your brain is destroyed. If you have 0 hit points or worse, you will also be incapacitated in Death until you succeeded on your stabilisation saving throw. A stabilisation roll is considered a Death saving throw and will consist of a Charter Strength saving throw at the end of your turn. Upon success, you will stabilize, will no longer be incapacitated, and stop your decent towards the seventh gate. Upon failure, you will go down one layer of Death, ever closer to true death.

##### Death stabilisation DC per layer
| Current Layer | Destroyed body | 0 Hit points | 1+ Hit points |
|:----:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| 1  | Automatic Failure  |Automatic Failure  | Automatic Success |
| 2  | Automatic Failure	|12  | 8  |
| 3 | Automatic Failure 	|14  				| 10 |
| 4 | 15 					|15  				| 12 |
| 5 | 18 					|17  				| 14 |
| 6 | 21 					|19  				| 16 |
| 7 | 25 					|22  				| 18 |
  
### Descending Death Layers 
You can intentionally descend death layers by using your movement. You use your full movement to descend one layer. You can use a dash action to quickly descend another layer.

### Grappling creature in Death
If you are above 1 hit point, stabilized and you are on the same layer as another creature, you can attempt to grapple the creature. Distance to the target is irrelevant for this grapple check whilst these conditions are true. You will automatically succeed in grappling a stabilized willing creature. You have advantage on grappling a willing creature. Grappling a creature will stabilize them.

Whilst grappled, they will move with you, if you decide to either ascend or descend Death layers. You can grapple up to two creatures in Death, given they are both willing. The grappled creature can use its action to grant you advantage on climbing Death layers.

<div style='margin-top:240px'></div>

### Force creatures down
If you are above 1 hit point, stabilized and you are on the same layer as another creature, you can attempt to shove the creature through the next gate. Distance to the target is irrelevant for this shove check whilst these conditions are true. You must make a Strength + Aptitude skill check opposed by either a Strength + Aptitude skill check or an Agility + Aptitude skill check. The target has disadvantage if the creature is not considered stabilized. On success, the target creature is pushed one layer down, but will stay stabilized if it was before.

### Climbing Death layers
It is possible to claw back from Death back into life if you have a body to return to. Without a body, you will require help from either a necromancer or a creature with equivalent magical powers.

To climb a layer without magic, you will have to overcome not only the physical water flow of the gate but also its life draining properties. To climb a layer, you can use your action to make a Death saving throw. On success, you will climb one layer. If you climb from layer one up, you will return to Life and your body. The ice around your body will evaporate, but you will still feel the damp and cold of Death.
On a failure you will stay on your current layer. If you fail the DC by 5 or more or roll a one on the die, you will be dragged along with the water. You will no longer be considered stabilized and will immediately drop one layer. You do not get to make a Death stabilisation saving throw at the end of this turn.

##### Climbing Death layers DC
| Current Layer | 0 Hit points | 1+ Hit points |
|:----:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| 1  | Automatic Success  | Automatic Success |
| 2  | 12					| 8  |
| 3 | 13				 	| 10 |
| 4 | 14 					| 12 |
| 5 | 16 					| 14 |
| 6 | Automatic Failure 	| Automatic Failure |
| 7 | Automatic Failure 	| Automatic Failure |

## Example character
Sabriël is a level 1 Spellslinger with a Sage background. She chooses the Charter mage subclass and to use the standard array of ability scores. She upgrades her Aptitude score. She finishes by electing to be proficient in the Strength, Constitution and Charisma Charter saving throws. 

Her choices (and her equipment) mean that she gains the following stats:

- +1 to initiative
- A maximum stamina of 14 (5 + 3 + 2 + 4)
- 15 AC (14 + 1)
- 30 movement speed
- Passive perception of 11 (10 + 1)
- Spell Attack Bonus of +8 (4 + 4)
- Spell DC of 13 (8 + 1 + 4)
- +0(AGI 0 + 0) to hit with her dagger, and a +0(AGI) damage modifier.

#### Skill modifiers

Here are Sabriël's skill modifiers. She has chosen her Strength to be her lowest skill, putting the 8 from the standard array in Strength, making her Strength modifier -1. Her Physical Strength saving throw consists of her Reflexes modifier added up to her Strength modifier, becoming +0. She is proficient in her Charter Strength saving throw and this is her Aptitude and Strength modifier combined resulting in a +4 (+1, +4, -1).

| Ability | Score | Skill Check Modifier | Physical Saving | Charter Saving |
|:--------:|:-----:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
| Strength 		|8	|-1 | +0 	| +4* |

# Classes

## Runic Knight

A Burly hulk charging into a pack of Undying, Throwing them every which way. With vicious slashes he ends the free magic spawn on the ground. 
An archer providing cover for her companion, fires a barrage of arrows with such force, some pierce through multiple enemies. Finally, she spots her target, Shouting his location to her allies.
A heavily plated Warrior flies through the air, landing next to the cowering necromancer with a resounding slam. He bashes his shield into the face of the surprised free magic user. 

All of these are Runic knights, unparallel weapon specialists and adept at enchanting their gear. Each is a warrior well acquainted with Death and its spawn. Each uses the Charter in unique ways to guide their weapons and shield their allies.

Runic knights learn the basics of all weapons and imbuements. Whether fighting with an axe, a longsword or a bow, the knight is sure to leave devastation in his or her wake. Each Runic knight specializes in a specific fighting style, some choosing more offensive styles, some more defensive, but each is highly skilled in all. 

When building a Runic knight, consider where you got your martial training and what style of fighting you are specialized in. Where did you get your training in imbuing your gear with the Charter and how does your runic knight excel in repelling the Undying. 
You may have enjoyed formal training in a private army, or had a mentor in the guard, or self-taught, unrefined but hardened by fighting off waves of Undying. All these considerations lead to molding the character to explore the wide world of the Old Kingdom with.


### Class Features
::**Hit Dice:** 2d12 per Runic Knight level
::**Hit Points:** 2d12 (or 13) + your Constitution modifier per Runic Knight level. Maximum values on level 1.
::**DC:** 8 + (Strength or Agility) + Aptitude
::**Magic Type:** Charter



#### Proficiencies
___
::**Armour:** Shields, Medium armour, Heavy armour
::**Weapons:** Simple weapons, Martial weapons

#### Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

- *(a)* five javelins or *(b)* any simple melee weapon
- *(a)* Chain mail or *(b)* a Chain shirt
- *(a)* Dungeoneer's pack or *(b)* a Burglar's pack
:
#### Subclasses
The Runic Knight knows 3 subclasses which you choose one of at level 1. The available options are Warrior, Ranger or Guardian.

### Diamond of protection
You can cast a ritual of 5 minute to create a diamond shaped protection dome of up to 25ft at the widest. This means the diamond has widths of the following sizes from left to right: 5ft-15ft-25ft-15ft-5ft. The Undying, free magic creatures or effects caused by these creatures cannot cross the dome. Whether alive, dead or a free magic creature, a creature can opt to attack the dome. The dome has 15 AC and cannot be moved in any way. The dome has 10 * (Runic Knight level + Aptitude Modifier) in hit points. The dome lasts for as long as you are in it.
Any creatures whose body is within the dome add the creators Aptitude modifier to any Death saving throws.

This ritual can be shortened by using up Charter imbued silver. Imbuing the silver will take roughly 1 minute per 100 silver coins or equivalent pure silver and the silver will remain imbued with 1 week. See the following table to see how much this can speed up the ritual for the amount of silver.

| Silver Cost | Time reduced to |
|:----:|:---|
| 100   | 2 minutes |
| 500   | 1 minute |
| 2500  | 12 seconds |


#### Imbue
::**Casting Time:** 1 action
::**Range:** touch
::**Components:** S
::**Duration** 24 hours
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

You can imbue your weapon to gain additional benefits. Only you can gain benefits from weapons you enchanted. The imbuement will last for one day. This action is free the first time on a day, but any further imbuement will expend two stamina. At 8th level, you can imbue for free twice a day. Hits with an imbued weapon will be critical on a 19 and 20 on the die roll. The weapon imbuement will also grant **one** of the following benefits:

 - Change your weapon damage type to either Fire, Thunder
 - Grant +5 movement speed
 - Grant a minimum initiative of 10
 
 
 Alternatively, you can imbue a cloak. Any creature wearing the cloak or else if their physical body is covered by the cloak (even if encased in ice), will always count as having 1+ hp in Death. Their maximum hit points also rise by 6 + 2 x Runic Knight level.

## Level 3
#### Shield Toss -3 Stamina
_Requires a shield_

Make a weapon attack on a creature you can see within 90 feet using your shield. Consider the shield a melee weapon with the Impact attribute, dealing 2d8 base weapon damage.

On hit, the creature must succeed on a Physical Constitution saving throw or be considered Dazed for 1 story tick. The shield is considered as if placed on the ground in the location of the target.

If you miss, the shield will continue in a straight line for the range of this ability. If the shield intersects with another creature, make a new attack roll for this new target. If the shield hits an object such as a wall, or reaches the end of the range, the shield is placed at that location.

_Exert: After hitting a creature, the shield will bounce to a new target you choose within the remaining range._

## Level 4

## Level 7

You can pick up a shield from the ground as a free action, given it is not worn or considered stuck.

## Level 9
### Spectral Shield 
Even if you don't have a shield equipped, a spectral shield protects you. You are always considered to be wielding a shield and have a bonus associated with wielding a shield. You can use this spectral shield for Stamina abilities that require a shield, but it will reappear next to you at the end of your turn.

## Spellslinger
A stout woman calmly removes a bell from her bandolier, looks at the giant Undying creature storming at her. With a clear single note, the fetid abomination is frozen in its tracks.
To her side, a priest of the charter seems in full concentration, his charter mark flashing, as suddenly the ground under a group of foul creatures twists and turns into a massive mudslide. 
Cackling, a soot covered sorceress looks at the result of her fiery incantations. A field filled with circles of fire and ice; the targeted horde of free magic creatures disintegrated.
:
Spellslingers are adept at using the raw power of the charter to coax the elements to their advantage. Using specifically tuned bells and incantations, the spellslinger either conjures massive water walls to protect, or ruptures the earth to devastate.
:
All spellslingers aim for mastery of the charter. Whether from a more religious angle, or on a quest for power, the spellslinger is always striving to become more in tune with the charter and its implements.
:
The most important question to answer when creating your spellslinger is the origin of your attunement to the charter. Were you taught by a village mage, trained by the religious order, or did you get your powers by experimentation? 
What is your stance on parents refusing to place a charter mark on their child or on the users of free magic.
Your history and your stance on the politics around the charter form the basis of your journey to explore the charter and the Old Kingdom at large.

::::::
{{wide
### Bells

Recharge die is d10. Each use of the bell is an action.

| Bell | Recharge | Effect |
|:----:|:---:|:--|
| **Kibeth**  | 7-10 | Choose a target Undying within 60 ft. Depending on the tone, it will either daze the target Undying or else grant freedom of movement to the Undying. The Undying can opt to make a Charter Intelligence saving throw to resist the Daze effect. If it is granted freedom of movement, then their movement no longer provokes attacks of opportunity and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce the target’s speed nor cause the target to be paralyzed or restrained. Ringers’ choice. Either effect will lasts up to 1 minute.|
| **Ranna**  | 6-10 | The sound of this bell sends creatures into a magical slumber. Roll 4d8 + 2xd8 Spellslinger level; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can affect. Creatures within 30 feet of you, but excluding you, are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures). Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell falls unconscious until the spell ends, the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. Subtract each creature’s hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature’s hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected. The ringer must make a DC Charter Intelligence saving save or also fall asleep. You can use your action to wake a sleeping person. |
| **Dyrim**  | 9-10 | Create a stationary reverberating echo originating from the ringer with a radius of 30ft. The echo will either decrease the DC of any Bell Magical effect by 3 + Spellslinger level for 1 minute or else removes an ongoing echo. Any concentration checks done within the echo by creatures other than the ringer are done at disadvantage.|

The earthen spire is 10ft high, has 10hp and 10 AC.

## Level 7
### Meta Magic tactics
At 7th level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs. You gain three of the following Meta Magic options of your choice. You can use only one Meta Magic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted. You can change your choice at a later time following the rules for tactics.

##### Careful Spell
When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell's full force. To do so, you spend 2 stamina and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma skill check modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell.

##### Empowered Spell
When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 2 stamina to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma skill check modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls. You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different Meta Magic option during the casting of the spell.

##### Extended Spell
When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 3 stamina to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours. If you extend the duration of a spell that requires concentration, you gain advantage on checks made to maintain concentration on the spell. 

##### Heightened Spell

##### Transmuted Spell
When you cast a spell that deals a type of damage from the following list, you can spend 2 stamina to change that damage type to one of the other listed types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, thunder.

##### Twinned Spell
When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn't have a range of self, you can exert the spell to target a second creature in range with the same spell. To be eligible for Twinned Spell, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell's current level. This can be done in combination with existing exertion options on the spell, resulting in a four times higher stamina cost.

##### Sculpt Spell
When you cast a spell with a range that affects an area, you can expend 2 stamina to change the area's shape in one of the following ways:

- If the spell's range is a line, you can change it to a cone of half range.  
- If the spell's range is a cone, you can change it to a 5-foot-wide line with double range.  
- If the spell's range is a sphere, you can change its area to a cylinder of half radius and double height.

You can inspire others through stirring words or charter imbued music. To do so, you use a Bonus Action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Inspiration die, a d4.

Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, Attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls The D20 before deciding to use the Inspiration die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Inspiration die at a time.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Aptitude modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

The charmed target must use its action before moving on each of its turns to make a melee attack against a creature other than itself that you mentally choose. The target can act normally on its turn if you choose no creature or if none are within its reach.

As a Charter mage you can infuse surfaces and objects with stamina-costing abilities. The surface needs to be at least 5ft square and the object needs to be at least 5ft cubed or equivalent surface size. The trigger and spell's target need to be set at casting, in addition to the behaviour if it was not triggered at the end of the duration. The infuse cannot trigger on vision- or proximity-based events occurring more than 20ft from the infused surface. The infuse also cannot trigger on events the caster could not reasonably perceive, such as the heat change of somebody entering a room.

The infusement seeps into the target surface or object and cannot be naturally perceived, but can be detected from 50ft by a Charter Charisma skill check opposed by your DC.

### Baptism
As an action you can baptize an unmarked, willing and living creature. If a creature is unconscious, it is considered willing. A Charter mark will appear on their forehead.

<div style='margin-top:140px'></div>



#### Anoint
::**Casting Time:** 1 action
::**Range** Touch
::**Components** V, S
::**Duration** 1 minute
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

As an action you can bless an area of water, either liquid or solid, that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. Any Undying either within the body of water or drenched in it will take 1d10 radiant damage. Any non-dead creature within or covered by the blessed water will have advantage on any Death stabilisation checks.

<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

You create a mudslide in a line of 60 feet long and 15 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a Physical Agility saving throw. A creature takes 1d8 + Spellslinger level bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Target visible creature gains 2d8 + 3x Spellslinger level in temporary hit points as a see-through armour of water forms around the target.

#### Wall of Water -1 Stamina
::**Casting Time:** 1 action
::**Range** 60ft
::**Components** V, S, M (A drop of water)
::**Duration** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

You conjure up a wall of water on the ground at a point you can see within range. You can make the wall up to 30 feet long, 10 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or you can make a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall vanishes when the spell ends. The wall’s space is difficult terrain.

Any ranged weapon attack that enters the wall’s space has disadvantage on the attack roll, and fire damage
is halved if the fire effect passes through the wall to reach its target. Spells or projectiles that deal cold damage that pass through the wall cause the area of the wall they pass through to freeze solid (at least a 5-foot square section is frozen). Each 5-foot-square frozen section has AC 5 and 15 hit points. Reducing a frozen section to 0 hit points destroys it. When a section is destroyed, the wall’s water doesn’t fill it. 

#### Last Rites
::**Casting Time:** 1 minute
::**Range** touch
::**Components** S
::**Duration** Instantaneous
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

By touching the charter mark of either a corpse, or else a person encased in Death ice, you can give them their last rites. Their body will ignite with a bright white flame, reducing it to ash. The flame does not affect any worn of surrounding objects, such as clothes or the floor. Once a body is reduced to ash in this manner, it cannot become or inhibit an Undying.

Only bodies which have a charter mark can be given the Last Rites. This spell leaves faint charter magic traces that another Charter mage can pick up for up to 3 days, by touching the location.

## Level 3

### Echo Tactics 
At 3rd level, you gain one of the following features of your choice. You can change your choice at a later time following the rules for tactics.

::::::::::::

##### Second wind
Whenever you hit a target with a Thunderbolt or Fire claw attack, as part of the same action you can strike the same target with one of your stamina abilities. The stamina ability must be centred on the original target and will cost 1 additional stamina to use. Any limitations on targeting the stamina ability, such as range or requiring sight, still apply.

You personally are immune to any adverse effects of the stamina ability.

##### Doubling trouble
Whenever a target fails a saving throw against one of your stamina abilities, as part of the same action, you can strike the same target with either a Thunderbolt or Fire claw attack. This can be used on multiple targets from same stamina ability, but costs 1 stamina per target. This can be used only once per stamina ability and on only once per target. Any limitations on targeting the Thunderbolt or Fire claw attack, such as range or requiring sight, still apply.

## Level 4
#### Meld into stone -3 Stamina
::**Casting Time:** 1 action
::**Range** Touch
::**Components** V, S
::**Duration** 8 hours  
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>


You step into a stone object or surface large enough to fully contain your body, melding yourself and one willing creature and all the equipment you carry with the stone for the duration. Using your movement, you step into the stone at a point you can touch. Nothing of your presence remains visible or otherwise detectable by non-magical senses.
While merged with the stone, you can’t see what occurs outside it, and any Wisdom (Perception) checks you make to hear sounds outside it are made with disadvantage. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while merged in the stone. You can use your movement to leave the stone where you entered it, which ends the spell. You otherwise can’t move.
Minor physical damage to the stone doesn’t harm you, but its partial destruction or a change in its shape (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals 6d6 bludgeoning damage to you. The stone’s complete destruction (or transmutation into a different substance) expels you and deals 50 bludgeoning damage to you. If expelled, you fall prone in an unoccupied space closest to where you first entered.

## Flesh Binder

A thin spear of bone pierces through the group of cultists, several exploding in gory explosions. A wall of burning spirits hold off the cultists from the bone conjurer and her allies.

Using the reprieve, a long-haired woman jumps into Death, quickly retrieving her ally from the first precinct. She quickly follows it up by ripping the life force out of one of her foes, healing her ally to full fighting fitness.

Blinking the Death ice out of his eyes, a tall, robed man commands his even taller clay friend back into the fray. The soul-infused clay golem races towards its first foe, unhinges his jaw and swallows it whole.
:
Flesh binders are masters of using tuned bells and free magic to command their Undying minions to do their bidding. Controlling blood, bone and flesh, flesh binders overwhelm their enemies and revitalize their allies.
:
Whilst the foul-smelling free magic has a bad reputation, it is merely a powerful tool in the hands of the flesh binder. Whether used for good or evil, they and their minions are a force to be reckoned with.
:
As a flesh binder, you will have to deal with free magic's somewhat deserved bad reputation. Do you keep your Undying allies out in the open, or do you pretend to be an innocuous charter mage? Given its bad reputation, you will also have to think of how and where you learned your craft. Did you break free from a cult lead by an evil necromancer, or did the Abhorsen see your potential and give you a few quick starters?
However you build your flesh binder, your tale will be filled with tension and unique ways of solving your tribulations in the Old Kingdom.


### Class Features
::**Hit Dice:** 2d6 per Flesh Binder level
::**Hit Points:** 2d6 (or 7) + your Constitution modifier per Flesh Binder level. Maximum values on level 1
::**Spell Attack bonus:** Charisma + Aptitude
::**DC:** 8 + Charisma + Aptitude
::**Magic Type:** Free Magic

#### Proficiencies
::**Armour:** Light armour
::**Weapons:** Simple weapons

#### Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
- Bell bandolier containing a Saraneth, Mosrael, Belgaer and Astarael bell
- *(a)* a quarterstaff or *(b)* a light crossbow and 20 bolts
- Leather armour
- *(a)* Priest's pack or *(b)* a Explorer's pack

#### Subclasses
The Flesh Binder knows 3 subclasses which you choose one of at level 1. The available options are Occultist, Hemathurge or Animator.
:::::::::::
{{wide
### Bells
Recharge die is d10. Each use of the bell is an action.

| Bell | Recharge | Effect |
|:----:|:---:|:--|
| **Saraneth**  | 8-10 | Choose target Undying you can see within 60ft range. The target as well as any Undying within 5ft radius must make a Charter Charisma saving throw or be bound to your will. The Undying gains a bonus equal to their CR, rounded down, for this saving throw. Undying already bound by another user will have advantage on this saving throw. See Keeper of the dead for additional information.|
| **Mosrael**  | 7-10 | **This bell only works in Death.** Choose a target on the same layer of Death. The target and any others within 10ft must make a Charter Charisma saving throw or be lifted one layer of Death up. Any affected creature can choose to fail the saving throw. The ringer is thrown one layer of Death down regardless of success. If any effected creatures either have 0 hit points or is classified as an Undying, the creature will have disadvantage on this saving throw.|
| **Belgaer**  | 9-10 | Choose a target within 20ft. You can make the target forget about an event of maximum 5 minutes if the target fails a Charter Intelligence saving throw. Or you can restore memory erased by a Belgaer bell. This will always restore all erased memories and cause the target to gain one level of exhaustion.|
| **Astarael**  | 10 | **This bell only works in Life.** All creatures within 40ft radius must make a Charter Strength saving throw. Undying creatures have disadvantage on this saving throw. Any creature who fails the saving throw is thrust 3 layers into Death. The ringer automatically fails the saving throw. |

### Keeper of the dead
Using the power of Saraneth, you can control Undying. There is a limit to how many Undying and how powerful Undying you can keep under your control for long periods. The Medium Undying are twice as hard to keep under control as Lesser Undying with the Greater Undying being twice as hard to keep under control as Medium Undying. You can use any combination of Undying you like. For example, you can have two Lesser Undying and one Medium Undying or one Greater Undying or four Lesser Undying. 

You can keep more Undying under your control for a short time, but once this time runs out, all the Undying under your control will break loose. They will no longer be bound by you and cannot be bound for the next day.
As an action, you can spend a minute to banish an Undying under your control back to Death.

Consult the following table to find the maximum amount of Undying you can keep under control, what maximum challenge rating Undying you can keep and for how long you can maintain control after going over the maximum.

| Level | Maximum Lesser Undying | Maximum Challenge Rating Undying | Control Time while over Maximum |
|:----:|:-:|:-:|:---|
| 1-2  | 2  | 2 | 3 story ticks |
| 3-4  | 4  | 3 | 5 story ticks |
| 5-7  | 6  | 5 | 10 story ticks |
| 8-10 | 10 | 6 | 15 story ticks |

The Undying have their own initiative, but follow your commands. Communicating commands to your Undying is done as a free action on your turn. The dead on their turn will try as best as they can to perform these commands. You can only change these commands on your turn. If you for instance tell an Undying to walk left and attack enemies there, but between your turn and the Undying's turn the enemies died, the Undying will still walk left.

You can only command Undying that are on the same plane of existence. For instance, if you step into Death, either willingly or forcedly, whilst you have Undying under your control remaining in Life, they will continue following their most recent commands. Any Undying you control in Death, you can give new commands to.

::::::::::::::
#### Death awaits
::**Casting Time:** 1 action
::**Range** 100 feet
::**Components** V, S 
::**Duration** Instantaneous
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

You point at one creature you can see within range, and the target is reminded of the frailty of life. The target must succeed on a Charter Intelligence saving throw or take 1d6 + Aptitude modifier necrotic damage. If the target is missing any of its hit points or is an Undying, it instead takes 1d10 + Aptitude modifier necrotic damage.

The spell’s damage increases by one die when you reach 3th level (2d6 or 2d10), 6th level (3d6 or 3d10), and 9th level (4d6 or 4d10).

The blood lands in target location and will start to fester and grow into something resembling a corpse. This sculpted corpse counts as a corpse that died today. This corpse can be further manipulated using the Saraneth bell as an action, transforming the corpse into a Lesser Undying of Challenge rating 1 or lower under your control. This will put the Saraneth bell in recharge.

_Exert: Casting time becomes a bonus action. Corpse transformation into a Lesser Undying remains an action._

### Ability Score Improvement 

When you reach third level and again at 6th, 8th and 10th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Instead of increasing your ability scores, you can instead take a feat, chosen from the feats chapter.

##### Greater Blood Sword
Whenever you create a blood sword, you gain two. Additionally, the Blood Sword spell no longer requires concentration. 

##### Crippling Spells
Enemies have disadvantage on saving throws against any of your stamina costing spells that cause the target to gain a condition, disease, curse or otherwise debilitating effects.

A non-magical wall composed of a wild assortment of bones springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of 3 5-foot-by-5-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other panel. 

If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (their choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Physical Agility saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.

The wall is an object made of bone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per panel. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the GM’s discretion. The wall disappears when the spell ends.

_Exert: 4 panels with 40 hit points per panel._

#### Quick Build
You can make an Animator quickly by following these suggestions. First, Constitution should be your highest ability score, followed by Aptitude. Second, choose the hermit background.  Third, choose the Charter saving throw protection bonus, picking at least Charisma and Intelligence saving throws.

### Mordicant
  The Animator can create their own Undying by using Free Magic. The Mordicant has a set of base stats and actions, which can be expanded depending on your Flesh Binder level. The Animator can then makes adaptations to the Mordicant, which can be found in the Mordicant Adaptation table. Every adaptation will require a certain amount of adaptation points, depending on how extensive the change is. To change a Mordicant, or to return it from Death, you require a corpse of a humanoid non-Undying that died within the past week. 
  
  A Mordicant counts as a Greater Undying towards your maximum amount of Undying, but will never break free of your control for being over your maximum number of Undying controlled. If the Mordicant is bound by another creature than you, the Mordicant will simply not move or attack until it is returned to your side. Consult the following table to find how many adaptation points you have at specific levels. 

<div style='margin-top:140px'></div>

#### Soul Bond
To create the Mordicant, you have bonded your soul to your Mordicant and are able to control the Mordicant even if you are considered unconscious or if you are in Death. Due to this soul bond, if your Mordicant dies, you get 40% of his hp as Psychic damage rounded down. The Mordicant has its own initiative but follows your commands.

## Mysticist
A white-haired, dark-skinned woman glares at the rampaging stilken. A giant ghostly fist appears above the free magic creature and stomps it into the ground.
Her ally, a simple looking lady with flowers in her hair, swiftly raises her bow, its arrow dripping poison. Ready to fire, should the stilken manage to rise.
From the top of a dodgy mechanical horse, a man whose hair seems to have been struck by lightning at least once, commands his constructs forward, surrounding the stilken.
:
Mysticists are the most varied and creative of all the charter magic users. Whether predicting their target's demise, rapidly awakening nature or constructing the most wonderful metal creatures, mysticists have an answer ready.
:
Where Runic knights focus their charter magic on enchanting their gear and spell slingers on conjuring the elements, mysticists focus on changing their surroundings. Always curious, always looking to learn. Nothing is impossible in the eyes of a mysticist, if you set your mind to it and as long as you dedicate enough time to it.
:
Mysticists must figure out how their curiosity is triggered and how they scratch that itch. Rewriting history, brewing potions or powering constructs with natural lightning are all within the possibilities. Using this knowledge, will you assist the common folk, or will you immortalize your legacy in thick tomes. However you use the result of your studies, you are sure to leave your mark on the Old Kingdom.

### Brew healing potion 
As a mysticist, you know how to brew healing potions and gain proficiency in Herbalism kits. To do this, you must gather the required herbs and brew them to a potion. The cost represents the average cost for which a shop may sell the required herbs. Finding these herbs in the wild is generally rare. 

Making a healing potion takes one minute and requires an Intelligence + Constitution skill check. On a failed check, the ingredients are lost.

| Level | Healing potion type | Cost | DC | 
|:----:|:----------:|:-------:|:---------:|
| 1-2  | Minor 			| 25 GP		| 10 				| 
| 3-4  | 3x Minor		| 50 GP 	| 12 				|
| 5-7  | Greater		| 50 GP 	| 14 				|
| 8-10 | Superior		| 75 GP 	| 15 				|

### Speak with Small Beasts
Through sound and gestures, you may communicate simple ideas with Small or smaller beasts.

::**Components** V, S, M (a tiny bell and a piece of fine silver wire)
::**Duration** 8 hours
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

You create a temporary physical charter sending in the form of a mouse. This mouse will noiselessly circle an area within range that is no larger than a 30ft cube. Until the spell ends, the mouse alerts you whenever a tiny or larger creature touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that won't set off the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm is mental or audible.

A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping.

An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds within 60 feet.

The mouse has 6 hp and an AC of 16. It cannot attack and will automatically fail saving throws. If it is killed off in one blow, it will not set off the alarm (however, the attack itself may).

This additional attack can repeat until you miss your target.

A beam of crackling, blue energy lances out toward a creature within range, forming a sustained arc of lightning between you and the target. Make a ranged spell attack against that creature. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 + Aptitude modifier lightning damage, and on each of your turns for the duration, you can use your action to deal 1d10 + Aptitude modifier  lightning damage to the target automatically. The spell ends if you use your action to do anything else. The spell also ends if the target is ever outside the spell’s range or if it has total cover from you.

This spell’s initial and sustained damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 3th level (2d10), 6th level (3d10), and 9th level (4d10).

<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell ends, a writhing mass of thorny vines appears at the point of impact, and the target must succeed on a Physical Strength saving throw or be grappled by the magical vines until the spell ends. A Large or larger creature has advantage on this saving throw. If the target succeeds on the save, the vines shrivel away.

A creature grappled by the vines or one that can touch the creature can use its action to make a Strength skill check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target is freed.

### Portent
Glimpses of the future press in on your awareness. When you finish a long rest, roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature that you can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can replace a roll in this way only once per Story Tick.

Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.

At 6th level, you gain a third d20 from this ability.

### Sight

You can use your bonus action to gain advantage on a skill check or attack roll during your turn. Upon using Sight, you become dazed until the end of your next turn.

Once you have used Sight three times, you must finish a long rest before you can Sight again.

:::::

### Keen Mind

You can add your intelligence modifier to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons. 


#### Prophecy of Life -1 Stamina

::**Components** -
::**Duration** Concentration, 10 story ticks
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

You can attempt to influence the future of a creature encased in Death Ice, by connecting to the creature's history. By creating a bond to the Death ice of a creature and learning its past, you can alter its future. The bond is created upon touch, but will remain as long as you are concentrating on this spell, without requiring further direct contact.

#### Blast from the past -1 Stamina
::**Casting Time:** 1 action
::**Range** 60ft
::**Components** V, S
::**Duration** Concentration, Up to 1 minute

On a failed save, the target sees an illusion from an ancient enemy or equivalent creature the target fears. While under the effect of this spell, the target will treat the illusion as real. The target will be attacked by the illusion and will be so convinced that the target will take 2d8 psychic damage. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion. At the end of each of the target's turns before the spell ends, the target must make a Charter Intelligence saving throw or take 1d8 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends and the target will know who caused the illusion.

You will follow the creature or object, but will be able to look out in any direction of your choosing, which you can change at any time. During remembrancing, you are deaf and blind with regard to your Senses in your current time.

#### The eye of Orannis -3 Stamina

::**Range** Self
::**Components** S
::**Duration** Concentration, Up to 1 minute
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

Any creature that looks into your eyes from within 30ft will see all sorts of potential futures. You can magically force it to make a Charter Charisma saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the creature becomes dazed until the end of its next turn. If the creature fails the DC by 5 or more, it will be stunned while it is dazed. Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see you until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at you in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.

_Exert: Any failed saving throws leave the creature stunned, regardless how much it failed by._


## Level 2

### Danger sense
You can add your Intelligence modifier to your initiative modifier.

## Level 3

### Foresight Tactics 
At 3rd level, you gain one of the following features of your choice. You can change your choice at a later time following the rules for tactics.

##### Distraction
When you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack, you can predict that something bad will happen to the target. The next attack roll made against this target before the end of your next turn has advantage, due to some distraction. The target also has disadvantage on its next saving throw before the start of your next turn.

The GM will determine the distraction, depending on the location of the scene. Examples of distractions are random flashes of light, unfortunate wardrobe malfunctions, a shiny marble on the ground, an ice pail sliding down the targets collar or a loudly protesting stomach.

##### Disaster
When you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack, you can predict that something bad will happen to the target if within 120ft. On the targets next turn, disaster will strike the target, dealing 2d6 damage. The damage type depends on the disaster. This feature can be used only once per turn.

The GM will determine the disaster, depending on the location of the scene. Examples of disasters are random lightning strikes, massive dead birds falling on people, trees falling over, rocks falling from the ceiling or a forge overheating and spouting flames at the target.

### Ability Score Improvement 

When you reach third level and again at 6th, 8th and 10th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Instead of increasing your ability scores, you can instead take a feat, chosen from the feats chapter.

::**Range** 60ft
::**Components** S
::**Duration** Instantaneous

If the creature is hidden from study through either magic means, or it being so outlandish that it is outside your comprehension, you sense that it has no damage immunities, resistances, or vulnerabilities.

_Exert: This spell's range increases to 120ft._

<div style='margin-top:540px'></div>

#### Hand of the seer -4 Stamina
<div style='margin-top:-1px'></div>

::**Casting Time:** 1 action
::**Range** 120ft
::**Components** V, S
::**Duration** Concentration, up to 1 minute
<div style='margin-top:-1px'></div>

You create a Large hand of shimmering, translucent force in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. This hand will assist you in making any prophecies you make, a reality. The hand lasts for the spell’s duration, and it moves at your command, mimicking the movements of your own hand.

The hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your hit point maximum. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. It has a Strength of 26 (+8) and a Agility of 10 (+0). The hand doesn’t fill its space.

When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following effects with it.

- Clenched Fist. The hand strikes one creature or object within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for the hand using your game statistics. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 force damage.
- Forceful Hand. The hand attempts to push a creature within 5 feet of it in a direction you choose. Make a check with the hand’s Strength contested by the Strength check of the target. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your intelligence modifier. The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it.
- Grasping Hand. The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand’s Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. While the hand is grappling the target, you can use a bonus action to have the hand crush it. When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your spell casting ability modifier.
- Interposing Hand. The hand interposes itself between you and a creature you choose until you give the hand a different command. The hand moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with half cover against the target. The target can’t move through the hand’s space if its Strength score is less than or equal to the hand’s Strength score. If its Strength score is higher than the hand’s Strength score, the target can move toward you through the hand’s space, but that space is difficult terrain for the target.

This spell’s clenched fist option damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 6th level (5d8), 8th level (6d8), and 10th level (7d8).
This spell’s grasping hand option damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 6th level (3d6), 8th level (4d6), and 10th level (5d6).

## Level 5

### Fast learner
You can learn two stamina costing abilities of your choice from any class but the Runic Knight and Morphling. An ability you choose must be of a level you can cast. They count as regular stamina abilities for you.

<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

You can see and hear a particular creature you choose that is on the same plane of existence as you. The target must make a Charter Intelligence saving throw, which is modified by how well you know the target and the sort of physical connection you have to it. If a target knows you're casting this spell, it can fail the saving throw voluntarily if it wants to be observed.


{{column-count:1
| Knowledge | Save Modifier |
|:---:|:------------|
|Second hand (you have heard of the target) | 	+5|

|**Connection**| |
|Likeness or picture |	-2|

|Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, or the like |	-10|
}}
On a successful save, the target isn't affected, and you can't use this spell against it again for 24 hours.

On a failed save, the spell creates an invisible sensor within 10 feet of the target. You can see and hear through the sensor as if you were there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the duration. A creature that can see invisible objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of your fist.

Instead of targeting a creature, you can choose a location you have seen before as the target of this spell. When you do, the sensor appears at that location and doesn't move.

Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide as a bonus action by pressing yourself up against a tree, plant or bush, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. 

### Archery
You can add your intelligence modifier to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons. 

### Mix potion
Besides being able to brew the basic healing potions, you are able to craft more different kinds of potions. At level 1 you can choose 3 recipes, respecting level restrictions. At every level up, you can choose one additional recipe.

::::::::::::


#### Entangle -1 Stamina
::**Casting Time:** 1 action
::**Range** 90 ft
::**Components** V, S
::**Duration** Up to 1 minute
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

Grasping weeds and vines sprout from the ground in a 20-foot square starting from a point within range. For the duration, these plants turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.
    A creature in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a Physical Strength saving throw or be restrained by the entangling plants until the spell ends. A creature restrained by the plants can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.
    When the spell ends, the conjured plants wilt away.
    
_Exert: This spell now affects a 30-foot square._

#### Nature's ferocity -2 Stamina
::**Casting Time:** 1 action
::**Range** 60 ft
::**Components** V, S, M (a stalk of grass)
::**Duration** Concentration, up to 1 minute
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

You fill the air with a cloud of spinning thorns and leaves in a cube 10 feet on each side, centred on a point you choose within range. A creature takes 4d4 slashing damage when it enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there. 

You can move the cloud on subsequent turns by using a bonus action. Moving the cloud onto a creature does not count as the creature entering the cloud. 

#### Cloak of insects -3 Stamina
::**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
::**Range** Self
::**Components** V, S
::**Duration** Up to 1 minute
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

As a bonus action, you can surround yourself with a magical aura that looks like buzzing flies. The aura extends 5 feet from you in every direction, but not through total cover. It lasts until you're incapacitated or you dismiss it as a bonus action.

The aura grants you advantage on any checks involving intimidation, but disadvantage on all other skill checks involving Charisma. Any other creature that starts its turn in the aura takes poison damage equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 damage). You are considered to have half cover for all ranged attacks targeting you.

_Exert: The aura area increases to 10 feet in every direction._

### Gather Herbs
When taking a short rest, instead of relaxing, you can go gather herbs from your surroundings. If you do so, you cannot gain any benefits from your short rest, other than the gathered herbs. You can also gather herbs during a long rest, but this will not impact the benefits of the long rest.
Ask your GM if what herbs are available nearby and choose one of the available to gather. Make an Intelligence + Intelligence skill check, opposed by the DC found in the Herb Gathering & Brewing table. If you pass the DC, check the gather amount in the Gather amount relative to DC table. 

##### Gather amount relative to DC
| DC beaten by | Gather amount |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 0-1  | 1d4+1 |
| 2-5  | 1d6+2 |
| 6-10 | 1d6+4 |
| 10+ | 2d4+4 |

::**Duration** Up to 1 minute

You send a swarm of spectral flies and insects towards the target. The target must succeed a Physical Constitution saving throw or be infected. On a failed saving throw, the target takes 1d8 poison damage and the target will have a cloud of insects around it. Any attack rolls made by the target will be made as if its target has half-cover. The target will also be considered deafened. The target can spend his/her action to make a Physical Constitution saving throw, ending the swarm on a success.

This spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 4th level (2d8), 7th level (3d8), and 10th level (4d8).

### Ability Score Improvement 

When you reach second level, and again at 4th, 6th, 8th and 10th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Instead of increasing your ability scores, you can instead take a feat, chosen from the feats chapter.

:::::::::::::::::::::
## Level 3

### Herbal Tactics 
At 3rd level, you gain one of the following features of your choice. You can change your choice at a later time following the rules for tactics.

##### Potion adept
Whenever you use a potion on yourself or another creature, you can use one of your stamina moves as part of the same bonus action or action.

##### Poison adept
You lace any poisons you apply to your enemies with some additional charter magic. Any prepared or applied poisons are more potent for 24 hours while using this tactic. The DC of any saving throws against these poisons is raised by 4, and any lingering effects last twice as long. 

## Level 4

### Master of the Sickle
You have learned the ways of nature and are more able to quickly find the herbs you are looking for. You gain +2 for any gathering skills checks you make.

This bonus increases to +4 when you hit level 8.

You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of yellow, nauseating gas centred on a point within range. The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. The cloud lingers in the air for the duration.

Each creature that is completely within the cloud at the start of its turn must make a Constitution saving throw against poison. On a failed save, the creature spends their actions that turn retching and reeling. Creatures that don’t need to breathe or are immune to poison automatically succeed on this saving throw.

A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the cloud after 4 rounds. A strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour) disperses it after 1 round.

## Level 5
#### Bramble Briar -4 Stamina
::**Casting Time:** 1 action
::**Range** 90 ft
::**Components** V, S
::**Duration** Instantaneous
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

Choose a point you can see on the ground within range. A thick branch covered in thorns will rapidly grow on that location, only to violently explode and create a hail of thorns in a 20-foot cube centred on that point. Each creature in that area must make a Physical Agility saving throw. A creature takes 2d12 bludgeoning damage and 1d12 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

Any creature that takes damage from this ability, becomes poisoned for up to 1 minute. At the end of each turn, any affected creature can make a Physical Constitution saving throw to recover from the poison.

_Exert: This spell's damage is increased by 2d12 poison damage. Affected creatures also have disadvantage on their saving throws to recover from the poison._


## Level 6

#### Transport Via Plants -4 Stamina
::**Casting Time:** 1 action
::**Range** 10 ft
::**Components** V, S
::**Duration** 1 Story tick
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

This spell creates a magical link between a Large or larger inanimate plant within range and another plant, at any distance, within Life. You must have seen or touched the destination plant at least once before. For the duration, any creature can step into the target plant and exit from the destination plant by using 5 feet of movement.

::::::::::::::::::::::::

#### Wall of Thorns -3 Stamina
::**Casting Time:** 1 action
::**Range** 120 ft
::**Components** V, S, M (A handful of thorns)
::**Duration** Concentration, Up to 10 minutes
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

You create a wall of tough, pliable, tangled brush bristling with needle-sharp thorns. The wall appears within range on a solid surface and lasts for the duration. You choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick. The wall blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Physical Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7d8 piercing damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, the first time a creature enters the wall on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature must make a Physical Strength saving throw. It takes 7d8 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Level 8
#### Mirage Nature -3 Stamina
::**Casting Time:** 10 minutes
::**Range** sight
::**Components** V, S
::**Duration** 10 days
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

You make terrain in an area up to 1 mile square look, sound, smell, and even feel like some other sort of natural terrain. The terrain’s general shape remains the same, however. Open fields or a road could be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth valley.
Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures and make them seem natural. You can for instance make a house look like a cave or tree house. The spell doesn’t disguise, conceal, or add creatures.
The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground into difficult terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise impede movement through the area. Any piece of the illusory terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the spell’s area disappears immediately.
Creatures with true sight can see through the illusion to the terrain’s true form; however, all other elements of the illusion remain, so while the creature is aware of the illusion’s presence, the creature can still physically interact with the illusion.
 
#### Awaken -5 Stamina
::**Casting Time:** 8 hours
::**Range** Touch
::**Components** V, S
::**Duration** Instantaneous
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

After spending the casting time tracing magical pathways within a precious gemstone, you touch a Huge or smaller beast or plant. The target must have either no Intelligence score or an Intelligence of 3 or less. The target gains an Intelligence of 10. The target also gains the ability to speak one language you know. If the target is a plant, it gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it gains senses similar to a human’s. 
The awakened beast of plant assumes the statistics of the Force of Nature, although your GM may add or change its statistics if deemed appropriately.
The awakened beast or plant is charmed by you for 30 days or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. When the charmed condition ends, the awakened creature chooses whether to remain friendly to you, based on how you treated it while it was charmed.

### Infuse Item
You've gain the ability to imbue mundane items with certain magical infusions, turning those objects into magic items.

#### Infusing an Item
Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a nonmagical object and imbue it with one of your infusions, turning it into a magic item. An infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as specified in the infusion's description. If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement.

Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the infusion vanishes after a number of days equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day). The infusion also vanishes if you replace your knowledge of the infusion.

You can infuse more than one nonmagical object at the end of a long rest. the maximum number of objects appears in the Infusions Items table. You must touch each of the objects, and each of your infusions can be in only one object at a time. Moreover, no object can bear more than one of your infusions at a time. If you try to exceed your maximum number of infusions, the oldest infusion ends, and then the new infusion applies.
:::
#### Infusions Known
When you gain this feature, pick three infusions to learn. 
You learn additional infusions of your choice when you reach 3rd level (5 total), 6th level (8 total), and 9th level (12 total).

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the infusions you learned with a new one.

#### Magic Mark
::**Casting Time:** 1 action
::**Range** touch
::**Components** V, S
::**Duration** Indefinitely (see description)
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

You've learned how to invest a spark of magic into mundane objects. You touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action and give it one of the following magical properties of your choice:

 - The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.
 - Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long.
 - The object continuously emits your choice of an odour or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away.
 - A static visual effect appears on one of the object's surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like.

The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and end the property early.

You can bestow magic on multiple objects, touching one object each time you use this feature, though a single object can only bear one property at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with this feature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object). If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest property immediately ends, and then the new property applies.

#### Spark -2 Stamina
::**Casting Time:** 1 action
::**Range** 90 ft
::**Components** V, S

This spell’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 4th level (3d6 and 2d6), 7th level (4d6 and 3d6), and 10th level (5d6 and 4d6).

_Exert: The area of the lightning explosion is increased to 20feet from the target._

### Rapid Prototyping
As an action, you can build a variety of prototype constructs. Each of these has their own uses and special quirks, but also share a few characteristics. None of your prototypes are built to last or could be considered reliable, nor can you resist putting in a way to move them. 

Each prototype costs some stamina to create and has its own statistics block. Each prototype takes its turn right after yours, in the order of their remaining duration, starting with the prototype with the most duration. 

You also have the following actions with which you can interact with your prototypes:

- As a bonus action, you can move an active prototype under your control up to its movement speed.
- As an action, you can fix a prototype, resetting its duration and restoring 2d4 + 2 x Mysticist level hit points.
- If the duration of a prototype expires, they are no longer considered magical and stop functioning. They do still occupy their location and their location is considered difficult terrain (given the prototype is of size small or larger). 
- As an action, you can reactivate a broken prototype without spending the material components, but respending the stamina. This can only be done if their location is unoccupied.

There is a limit to how many prototypes you can have under your control, which can be found in the table below.

##### Prototypes
| Level | Max Active Prototypes |

On a failed saving throw the target takes 4d8 Lightning damage and the next attack roll made against it before the end of your next turn has advantage, thanks to the shock cramping their muscles. They take half damage on a successful saving throw and suffer no other adverse effects of this spell.

## Edge Dancer
With a flourish, a cloaked gangly man flings his rapier at the surprised necromancer. With hardly a sound the rapier imbeds itself in the torso, only to disappear in a puff smoke, reappearing in the hands of the cloaked figure.

Not wanting to be left out, his ally grabs one of the nearby Undying by its ankle, and throws the confused Undying into the confused necromancer, knocking both prone.

Taking advantage of the confusion, a woman with a scorpion-like tail dashes forward, who finishes the necromancer off with a quick strike with her stinger.

All of these characters are examples of Edge dancers. People who infuse their being with free magic, granting them strange and distorted powers to tackle their foes with.
:
Edge dancers are masters at confusing their enemies and, sometimes literally, turning their worlds upside down. Teleporting weapons, super human strength or growing new hazardous appendages are all within their grasp. They dance on the edge of humanity, defying comprehension.
:
The central question for an edge dancer to figure out, is how their free magic manifests itself. Are there permanent outward signs? How did you learn you could mingle with free magic and how comfortable with it are you? Do you embrace your powers or do you merely use them to survive? Were you shunned by your community, or perhaps revered?

However you decide to create your edge dancer, they are sure to have an impact in any social encounters, as well as on the battle field. They are guaranteed to carve out their own strange and curious stories in the lands of the Old kingdom.



### Class Features
::**Hit Dice:** 2d10 per Edge Dancer level
::**Hit Points:** 2d10 (or 11) + your Constitution modifier per Edge Dancer level. Maximum values on level 1
::**DC:** 8 + (Strength or Agility) + Constitution
::**Magic Type:** Free Magic

 - Leather armour
 - *(a)* Dungeoneer's pack or *(b)* a Explorer's pack

#### Subclasses
The Edge Dancer knows 3 subclasses which you choose one of at level 1. The available options are Trickster, Grappler and Morphling

### Dance Poses
At level 1 you get the ability to adopt fighting poses with which you can gain benefits until your next turn. Each of these poses require a bonus action to activate.

##### Reactive pose
Until the start of your next turn, you have two reactions.

##### Opportunity pose
Until the start of your next turn, the first attack of opportunity you hit, is an automatic critical hit.

##### Deflective pose
You can use your reaction to deflect a weapon until the start of your next turn. When you are hit by a melee weapon attack, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by your Strength or Agility skill check modifier.

##### Sly Pose
When you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to adjust your defences. Once you do, the creature has disadvantage on its attacks against you until you take damage from the creature again or the start of your next turn, whichever is sooner.

:::

# Equipment

## Weapons

### Brawn
A Brawn weapon is meant for slamming and bashing and can therefore only be used using your Strength. For the attack roll, you use 2 x Strength modifier. For the damage roll you add your Strength modifier.

### Nimble
A nimble weapon is meant for finding the chink in the armour, the gap in the targets defence. It can only be used using Agility. For the attack roll, you use 2 x Agility modifier. For the damage roll you add your Agility modifier.

### Impact
Impact weapons are a mix between Brawn and Nimble weapons. They require a fair amount of force with a precise aim, but will cause devastating damage on a successful hit. For the attack roll, you use Strength modifier + Agility modifier. For damage roll you add the Agility modifier and the Strength modifier.

### Finesse
When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you choose to use it as a Brawn weapon or as a Nimble weapon.

### Ammunition 
You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.

## Ammunition Modifications
Any costs listed are on top of the cost of the ammunition. Modifications can only be made to ammunition with the approval of the GM, to prevent things such as barbed trebuchet shots.

All damage listed is in addition to any regular damage the ammunition would deal on hit.
::::::
#### Barbed
Barbed ammunition will stick in the target on hit. If the target takes further damage, it must make a DC 10 Physical Agility saving throw or the barbed ammunition will be ripped out, dealing 1d6 piercing damage. The target or a creature within 5 ft of it can use its action to remove the ammunition.

#### Charter 
Charter enchanted ammunition can be activated using a free action by any creature wielding the ammunition and that is capable of charter magic. Charter ammunition is counted as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks and damage.

## Poisons

### Poison Types
Poisons come in the following four types:


#### Contact: 
Contact poison can be smeared on an object and remains potent until it is Touched or washed off. A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its Effects.

#### Ingested:
A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its Effects. The dose can be delivered in food or a liquid. You may decide that a partial dose has a reduced Effect, such as allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a failed save.

#### Inhaled: 
These poisons are powders or gases that take Effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot cube to its Effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately afterward. Holding one’s breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.

#### Injury:
Injury poison can be applied to Weapons, Ammunition, trap Components, and other Objects that deal piercing or slashing damage and remain potent until delivered through a wound or washed off. A creature that takes piercing or slashing damage from an object coated with the poison is exposed to its Effects.

#### Undying animals
Human corpses are not the only ones that can be used to make an Undying creature, putting human souls in animal corpses is also possible. The more whole soul and the closer in size the animal resembles a human, the more stable the resurrection is and the more human the Undying will act.

Animal Undying tend to keep some of their animal characterictics, but also dehumanizes the soul, specially if the animal is far smaller. Animal Undying tend not to be able to speak and have equivalent intelligence of the host animal. Souls released from an Undying animal are heavily damage and frayed, making it virtually impossible to infuse another corpse with the soul. The following Undying are merely some examples, but the possibilities are near endless.

It is also possible to infuse a heap of small animal corpses with a single soul, such as the Gore crows. The gruesome ritual requires a living human to be sacrificed and a fair amount of energy, but leads to a more human swarm of animals that act as one. Undying created in this method tend to be short lived, given this puts tremendous amounts of strain on a soul.

## Mirage
*Medium*  ***Free Magic Creature***

**Armour Class** :: 15
**Hit Points** :: 57
**Speed** :: 220ft., climb 20ft.

___
**Senses** :: Darkvision 60ft, passive Perception 17
**Languages** :: Common
**Challenge** :: 5
___
***Innate Spellcasting.*** The Mirage innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 15). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:
- At will: Mirror Image (5e), Cloud of Daggers (5e), Spark, Alter self, Disguise self

***Hallucinatory Terrain.***  The Mirage can make natural terrain in a 150-foot cube in range look, sound, and smell like some other sort of natural terrain, with a casting time of 1 minute. Thus, open fields or a road can be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the area aren’t changed in appearance.
The tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures entering the area are likely to see through the illusion. If the difference isn’t obvious by touch, a creature carefully examining the illusion can attempt a double Intelligence skill check against the Mirae's spell save DC to disbelieve it. A creature who discerns the illusion for what it is, sees it as a vague image superimposed on the terrain.
:
***Skitter Scatter.*** The Mirage points at a point it can see within 200 ft. A blinding light flashes over the targeted area, knocking back and blinding creatures in the area. Each creature in a 20 ft radius sphere is knocked 10ft away from the point. Each affected creature must also make a Physical Strength saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. Blinded creatures can make a Physical Strength saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the effect ends.
:
### Actions
:
***Longbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage.
