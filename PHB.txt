# World setting

## The Old Kingdom
The Old Kingdom corresponds roughly to Scotland in landscape. Ancelstierre (representing England) and the Old Kingdom travel differently through time, with the hour of the day and the season of the year rarely in synchrony; therefore it is possible to spend more time in the Old Kingdom than is absent from Ancelstierre.

It is very sparsely populated due to the many dangers the dead pose to the general population.

### Rulers
The Old Kingdom is ruled by a king and queen. The king is in charge of the military arm of the country while the queen is in charge of the rest. 

Their rule is hereditary. The first son or daughter is considered to be king- or queen-in-waiting. He/she will become the new ruler together with a partner chosen by him/her. This partner cannot be part of the royal line but must have an unsullied charter mark.

#### Abhorsen
This job title granted by the rulers of the Old Kingdom. The Abhorsen is tasked with keeping the Dead under control and sending them beyond the seventh gate. Generally a very gifted and strong Charter mage is picked who can also use Free Magic. This title can be held by one of the rulers should they choose to, but is generally given to another.

The Abhorsen will generally have several Abhorsen-in-waiting, as apprentices. The Abhorsen and his students have access to both Charter Magic and Free Magic and can therefore use all magic bells.

#### The Clayr
The Clayr are an oracular group composed nearly entirely of women, who live in a snowy mountain called the Clayr's Glacier, in the northern part of the Old Kingdom. Nearly all are beautiful and possess nut-brown skin, pale blond hair, and eyes of blue or green. The Glacier is also home to the Great Library of the Clayr, which contains a variety of treasures, monsters, and rarities in addition to books. Due to the Clayr's precognitive Sight, within the Great Library, there are often rooms created for events which unfold decades or centuries later. 

### Charter
Apart from being a source of magic, the Charter is also a form of religion. The common folk will generally choose to see the Charter as an omnipotent collection that protects them and grant the pious benefits. Powerful Charter Magic users will generally be seen as priests. A fair amount of the population can use very minor Charter Magic, for example to light a fire. These people will generally be considered favourably and will likely hold roles such as mayor.

The charter is also sometimes referred to as the Seven Bright Shiners.

<div style='margin-top:140px'></div>



### Towns
Most towns in the Old Kingdom will be walled to protect against the Dead. Villagers are often left to fend for themselves and are therefore generally quite close knit with a healthy dose of scepticism for outsiders.

### The Nine Bright Shiners
The most advanced and powerful Free Magic elementals, of which seven created the Charter and are represented by the bells. Of the remaining two, Yrael later became Mogget, the Abhorsens' companion; and Orannis, "last and mightiest of the Nine", opposed the Charter and was imprisoned by the Seven. The correlation of the Seven and the necromantic bells includes the Precincts of Death, with each bell equalling a specific Precinct.

Yrael, also known as Mogget, initially refused to take a side for or against Orannis, and was therefore later enslaved to the Abhorsen by the other immortals. Whenever unbound, he will try to kill the current Abhorsen and is thus rarely let out by the Abhorsen. To most Mogget appears as a small white cat but to others Mogget adopts a different name and appears as an albino dwarf. Mogget cannot use his dwarf-form without the express permission of the current Abhorsen or an Abhorsen-in-Waiting.

### Ancelstierre Technology
Most advanced technology will fail within the Old Kingdom. Cars will breakdown with welds coming apart and paint disintegrating into raw components. Machine fabricated clothes and paper will be reduced to scraps and rags. Guns will refuse to fire or will explode completely.

\page

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
## Ancelstierre
Ancelstierre is culturally and technologically based on pre-WWI Britain. There are boarding schools, biplanes and most of the long distance communication is based upon radio. Cars exist, but are somewhat rare and expensive. Most roads are made for carts and not for cars.

Ancelstierre is quite large and generally at war with its southern neighbours. The military plays a big role in the political landscape, but is beholden to the politicians.

Most southern consider magic a myth and will generally look down upon northern Ancelstierriens who actually deal with free and charter magic on a daily basis. Because of this, most army recruits coming from the south get a rude awakening if they are stationed in or near the Perimeter.

### The Wall
The Wall is made by two of the Bright Shiners from the Charter and separates Ancelstierre and the Old Kingdom. The Wall is a vast 30 ft high earthen wall stretching from coast to coast, looking akin to large dunes. The wall was made to protect other areas from the Dead and Orannis. The Dead cannot cross the Wall without sustaining damage or weakening them. This does not stop them from constantly trying to cross into Ancelstierre, where life is in abundance and poorly defended.

#### Crossing points
Over the years, several crossing points have been made in the wall. At these crossings the Wall is lowered to allow for easier trade. Because of this, the protections against the Dead are also lower here, making it a preferred place of entry for the Dead and their allies. Nowadays, all crossing points have guards on the Ancelstierre side of the wall in order to protect northern Ancelstierre.

### The Perimeter
The Perimeter is a roughly 20 mile wide strip of land on the Ancelstierre side of the wall. There is a heavy presence of military in this area. Due to the closeness to the wall, magic will generally work here and technology will often fail. There is no radio contact possible if strong winds are blowing from the Old Kingdom. 

The dead can generally survive in the Perimeter, but may combust if out during a bright day. Free and Charter magic will work in this area, but will fail the further from the wall it is used.

<div style='margin-top:240px'></div>



#### The Wall Garrison
The garrison tasked with securing the border is named the Wall Garrison. The Wall Garrison finds itself in a precarious position. It has a very high death rate under new recruits due to constant attacks from the Dead, but any reports about the Dead are dismissed as superstition by the generals down south. Their guns and trucks are prone to failure based on proximity to the wall. Therefore most soldiers who survive their initial confrontations with the Dead, will arm themselves with swords and bows. This is generally done out of pocket, given that any requests for issued medieval weaponry is denied by the capital.

Northern Ancelstierriens who have a knack for Charter or Free Magic will generally be put in small patrol groups spread throughout the Perimeter. If Dead are found attacking the wall, they will be called to save the regular soldiers.

#### Prohibited Zone
This is the area directly bordering the Wall and is filled with hand forged barbed wire and trenches. Due to the Dead commonly looking fairly human until they start attacking, it is hard to decipher if a person is human or Dead. Therefore the Wall Garrison has the policy to shoot any trespassers who cannot quickly identify themselves and have a permit to be near the wall. 

> ##### Prohibited zone border

> The prohibited zone's border is commonly marked by signs containing the following text:
>
> ##### Trespassers will be shot without warning!

## Magic
In the Old Kingdom, magic takes two forms: Free Magic or Charter Magic. The former is older, and natural in origin, whereas the latter is imposed as an assurance of order, by the immortal 'Seven Bright Shiners'. 

Some Free Magic remains in the world, mainly in various breeds of monsters and certain magic users. 

The Charter is described as an "endless flow" of symbols describing the cosmos; each used by magicians to achieve psycho kinesis. The composition of spells ranges from single Charter marks to long series requiring a 'master mark' and sometimes a physical focus (typically a sword or wand). 

Though Free Magic is 'corrosive' to living things and Charter Magic, Free Magic spells are required to pass the Gates of Death, and the calls of the bells are Free Magic spells subject to the Charter. Although the Abhorsen may use Free Magic without suffering long-term ill effects, typical Free Magic users are ultimately "devoured by the Free Magic they profess to master". Practitioners of Charter Magic have a Charter Mark drawn on their forehead at birth or later in life. Marks unsullied by Free Magic are used to identify true Charter Mages (as opposed to Free Magic sorcerers or constructs in disguise). Charter marks become invisible if you get too far from the Old Kingdom (roughly 75 miles). Most inhabitants of the Old Kingdom and northern Ancelstierre will have one. 

### The Five Great Charters

> ##### The Five Great Charters rhyme
>
> *Five Great Charters knit the land.*
>
> *Together linked, hand in hand.*
>
> *One in the people who wear the Crown.*
>
> *Two in the folk who keep the Dead down.*
>
> *Three and Five became stone and mortar.*
>
> *Four sees all in frozen water.*

This rhyme dictates that at some point in history the Five Great Charters were concentrated in physical objects, or human bloodlines. The bloodlines are those of the royals, the Abhorsen, the Clayr, and the Wallmakers. After this, the entire Wallmaker line physically became the Great Charter Stones and the Wall that separates the Old Kingdom from Ancelstierre, to prevent contamination of their descent. The Great Charter Stones are located in an underground reservoir in the Old Kingdom's capital, Belisaere, and are the sources of Charter Magic in the Old Kingdom. Under the influence of the Wall, magic, both Free and Charter, exists only in the Old Kingdom; but can be practised in northern Ancelstierre, and further south if there is a strong wind from the Old Kingdom. 

<div style='margin-top:140px'></div>

### Charter stones
Charter Stones are large stone monuments "with Charter marks running like quicksilver through the stone, forming and dissolving, only to reform again, in a never-ending story that told of the making of the world." They serve as an easy access point to the Charter for Charter mages, and suppress the Dead and any entrance to Death, but can be broken by Free Magic sorcerers with the use of the blood of a Charter mage. They can be mended by strong charter mages, using blood from a family line unsullied by free magic. The royal line is the most famous of these bloodlines, but others also exist within the Old Kingdom.

The Charter stones were originally created by the Wallmakers. There are many Charter Stones throughout the Old Kingdom that strengthen the presence of the Charter.

### The Bells

The bells of power are seven eponymous bells typically used by magic users to control the Dead, named after the Seven Bright Shiners who invested themselves in the Charter. 

Each bell has a specific power over the Dead and Free Magic creatures, and if used by a skilled magic user, also on living people. An errant or improper ring can affect the caster instead of the target, or cause other adverse effects.

From smallest to largest they are:

#### Ranna
The Sleeper, prompting drowsiness in the auditor

#### Mosrael
The Waker, transmitting the ringer further into Death but the auditor into Life

#### Kibeth
The Walker, which can give the Dead freedom of movement or force them to walk according to the ringer's intention;

#### Dyrim
The Speaker, used either to revive or annul the hearer's ability to speak;

#### Belgaer
The Thinker, used to restore or remove memory;

#### Saraneth
The Binder, a favourite of the Abhorsens, used to control the Dead directly; and

#### Astarael
The Weeper, also named Sorrowful, which sends both ringer and auditor far into Death.

### Bell bandoliers
People wearing bell bandoliers are generally considered suspicious by common folk. Unless directly associated to the Abhorsen, bandolier carriers could very well be necromancers looking for fresh Dead to collect.

## Creatures
Strictly speaking, there are five basic supernatural creatures in the Abhorsen world:

### The Dead
The Dead are ghosts with both the inclination and the ability to resist the river of Death, who re-enter the world of Life. Though a rare few emerge into Life on their own power, most must be summoned by a necromancer or emerge near a broken Charter Stone (where the Charter's influence has been severely diminished, creating a "door into Death"), or where many deaths have recently occurred. All Dead are averse to running water, and most are unable to withstand direct sunlight.

There are three classes of Dead: Lesser, Medium and Greater. The Greater Dead are usually represented by Dead from beyond the Fifth Gate (spirits from the deeper realms of Death and correspondingly more powerful). Greater Dead, such as Fifth-Gate Resters or Thralks, may exist in Life without a physical body (making them much more difficult to destroy).

The name of Lesser Dead refers to Dead Hands, Ghlims and Gore Crows: a range of re-embodied spirits, often used by necromancers as weapons. Lesser Dead may be incapacitated by immersing them in running water or by destroying their physical bodies with Charter Magic or explosives. Most Dead prey on the living to remain in Life.

### Constructs
Free Magic constructs are forms assumed by Free Magic elementals or powerful Dead spirits. Though such constructs may be destroyed, destroying the Elemental itself is much more difficult and typically the province of Free Magic.

### Mordicants
These are fiery constructs of clay and blood, animated by Free Magic and guided by a Greater Dead or Free magic user, able to move between Life and Death at will. They are fierce combatants, and seem to have enhanced senses, able to track specific targets over hundreds of miles, resisting direct sunlight to do so.

### Free Magic Elementals
These are free-willed beings wholly composed of Free Magic. The most common elementals belong to specific "breeds" (such as Stilken, Magrue, Jerreq, or Hish), while the most powerful are unique, or "of a singular nature". Though "many thousands" of Free Magic Elementals escaped the creation of the Charter, most were later imprisoned or enslaved by it. Of the remainder, "no truly dangerous creature of Free Magic has woken in a thousand years, save to the sound of Mosrael and Saraneth, or by a direct summons using their secret names". Some cannot be destroyed except by a Free Magic sorcerer more powerful than they, or by immersion in running water (though Free Magic creatures of the Third Kindred, or those infused with the essence of the Nine, are exempt from this rule). Charter Magic is typically ineffective.

<div style='margin-top:140px'></div>

### Charter Sendings
Charter Sendings are servants or sentries constructed entirely of Charter Marks. Many may only act within a given function, which can be of indefinite complexity. Certain fixtures excepted (such as a surcoat or insignia), Charter Sendings do not possess a concrete physical shape, and derive identity primarily from their function. They are capable of emotive response, but show little desire except to fulfil their mandates.

## Death

Death consists of Seven Precincts divided by Seven Gates, through which a grey river flows. Almost everything in Death is a bleak grey, and a subtle grey fogginess limits visibility. The river may also contain and conceal hostile dead beings, which attack living travellers. Free Magic users can cross the boundary at will. Dead spirits can cross only when aided by a Necromancer, or when the border is weakened by a concentration of (often violent) deaths. Dexterity and great willpower are required to resist the current, which is psychological as well as physical. Each gate responds to a Free Magic spell wielded by Abhorsens and Free Magic users; Dead cannot pass any Gate unless they are very powerful. Each Precinct contains a different peril.


#### First Precinct
The First Precinct is mostly knee-deep water, but has eddies and pools dangerous to the interloper. Its Gate is a huge waterfall.

#### Second Precinct
The Second Precinct has pitfalls throughout its domain and low visibility;  The Gate is a vertical river rising from the floor.

#### Third Precinct
The Third Precinct has slightly warmer ankle-deep water and visibility is slightly improved. Periodic, irresistible waves carry dead creatures through the Gate (a wall of mist), often beyond the final Seventh Gate.

#### Fourth Precinct
The Fourth Precinct has a low concentration of Dead, as most of those who reach it have been stunned by the Third Precinct's waves, and are carried easily to the dangerous and deceptively short waterfall that comprises its Gate.

#### Fifth Precinct
The Fifth Precinct is too deep to wade, and must be crossed by a thin black bridge that frequently attracts dead creatures. The water in the Fifth Precinct has strong mutagenic properties, and is implied to be partially responsible for the monstrous appearance of some Greater Dead and necromancers. Its Gate is a whirlpool. 

#### Sixth Precinct
The Sixth Precinct has no current, and its water is present as a shallow pool. There are many Dead creatures in this Precinct, some of whom are Greater Dead. The Gate has no substance and can appear anywhere, but appears as a lift bordered by a cylinder of water.

#### Seventh Precinct
The Seventh Precinct is an endless pool of deep, still and clear water. It is warmer than the other precincts and there is no fog, allowing a necromancer to see in every direction. The Seventh Gate, resembling a starry sky, confirms the final death of any who look upon it, except those to who retain a native span of years. Those claimed by the Gate rise at varying speeds and vanish, never to return.

### Dual Skill Checks
Skill checks, hit checks and saving throws will use a d20 as used in 5e.
Skill checks will consist of using the modifiers of two ability scores. This can be two of the same modifiers. For example, if the player has to carry a heavy object a fair distance, the GM could ask you to roll a d20 and add your Strength and Constitution modifiers. But if it was simply lifting a very heavy boulder, it might require a Strength + Strength check, known as a double Strength check.

#### Saving throws

There are three categories of saving throws, Physical, Charter and Death saving throws. Death saving throws will be discussed in the Death chapter. Both Physical and Charter saving throws will consist of a list of 5 ability score saving throws, namely Strength, Agility, Constitution, Intelligence and Charisma. Your Reflexes modifier will be added to each Physical saving throw and your Aptitude modifier will be added to the Charter saving throws.

For instance, if you have the following base modifiers: Strength +2, Agility +1, Reflexes +3, Constitution +0, Intelligence +0, Charisma +1 and Aptitude -1, your saving throw tables will look as following (ignoring proficiencies). Having a very high Reflexes score results in very good Physical saving throws, but the lacking Aptitude score means that Charter saving throws will be rough for this character.

##### Example Saving throws modifiers
| Ability score | Physical | Charter |
|:--------:|:-----:|:------:|
| Strength 		| +5 | +1 |
| Agility 		| +4 | +0 |
| Constitution 	| +3 | -1 |
| Intelligence 	| +3 | -1 |
| Charisma 		| +4 | +0 |

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

### Grappling

You can attempt to grapple a creature in melee range using a Strength + Agility skill check, contested by a either a Physical Strength saving throw or a Physical Agility saving throw of the target, targets choice. You cannot grapple a creature two sizes up from you and creatures two sizes down from you have advantage on Physical Agility saving throws.

### Shove
The shove attack will become a Strength + Strength contest opposed by a Strength + Agility or Strength + Reflexes skill check.

### Massive Damage
When a creature takes damage from a single source equal to or greater than half its hit point maximum, it must succeed on a DC 15 Physical Constitution saving throw or suffer a random effect determined by a roll on the System Shock table. For example, a creature that has a hit point maximum of 30 must make that Constitution save if it takes 15 damage or more from a single source.

##### System Shock
| d10 | Effect |
|:------:|:------:|
| 1  | The creature drops to 0 hit points |
| 2-3  | The creature drops to 1 hit points |
| 4-5 | The creature is stunned until the end of its next turn. |
| 6-7 | The creature can’t take reactions and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn. |
| 8-10 | The creature can’t take reactions until the end of its next turn. |

### Checking the Charter mark
Some creatures will have a Charter mark on their forehead. As an action you can check the Charter mark of a willing creature or a creature with speed 0. This will inform you whether they are considered Dead, a Free Magic creature or have any hiding in their bodies.

### Dazed
Dazed is a new condition which will reduce your speed by half, will let you either perform an action or bonus action and you can't perform more than one melee or ranged attack during your turn. This also breaks concentration.


### Concentration
Concentration saving throws use Charter Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration.

<div style='margin-top:140px'></div>

### Getting up from prone
In addition to using up half your speed, getting up from prone will also provoke attacks of opportunity. You are still considered prone for these attacks of opportunity.

### Flanking
When making a melee attack, you gain a +1 to all attack rolls if your opponent is threatened by a character or creature friendly to you on the opponent’s opposite border or opposite corner.

Only a creature or character that threatens the defender can help an attacker get a flanking bonus. Creatures with a reach of 0 feet can’t flank an opponent. 

### Jumping
Jumping works as 5e. However, do not forget that you need to spend a foot of movement for every foot of movement spent travelling through the air.

Any checks related to clearing obstacles use a DC 10 Strength + Agility skill check.

### Using potions
You can drink a potion as a bonus action, given the potion is already in your possession and reachable. 

You can spend an action to use a potion on a willing or unconscious creature. For this the potion must be reachable and not worn of carried by another creature. You can use this action to for instance feed a healing potion from your belt to an ally, or else to drink a potion left unsupervised on the counter. 

### Feats
A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides. At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat's description says otherwise.

You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat's prerequisite, you can't use that feat until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Grappler fear requires you to have a Strength of 13 or higher. If your Strength is reduced below 13 somehow - perhaps by a withering curse - you can't benefit from the Grappler feat until your Strength is restored.

### Exert
Some Stamina abilities allow you to exert them. You will get a stronger effect, but the ability will cost double the amount of stamina.

\page

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

### Changing Tactics
some groups of features are marked as a tactic. These are mutually exclusive features where a choice will have to be made which of the features you want for your character.
It is possible to switch between tactics in an extended downtime during which a character studies, exchanges charter marks or realigns ones psyche, as relevant for your character. This requires a long rest of at least 24 hours. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity—at least 1 hour of walking, Fighting, casting Spells, or similar Adventuring activity—the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it.

At the end, a character can change one of his or her tactics, as well as all the usual benefits from a long rest.

### Story time
Story time is what we call the time as the characters perceive it, from the perspective of being “in the story”—the amount of time it takes for them to accomplish any of the stuff you and the players say that they do during play. Most of the time, you’ll do this as an afterthought, mentioning it in passing (“Okay, so it takes you an hour to get back to the mayors house”) or mentioning it as part of a skill roll (“Cool, so after 20 minutes of sweeping the room, you find the following…”).

Under most circumstances, story time has no actual relation to real time. For example, a combat exchange might take a few minutes to play out in real time, but it only covers what happens in the first few seconds of a conflict. Likewise, you can cover long swaths of time simply by saying that it happens (“The contact takes two weeks to get back to you—are you doing anything while you wait, or can we just skip to the meeting?”). When used this way, it’s really just a convenience, a narrative device in order to add realism and some consistency to your story.

The length of a 'story time unit' will very heavily between scenes. Therefore it is not always logical to use absolute values of time for certain game mechanics. The story you are trying to tell might lose a fair amount of its tension if you see somebody getting attacked 200 meters away if you know that person will be sent to Death and permanently have died by the time you can get there. This is why certain game mechanics where this is relevant will refer to Story Ticks instead of minutes or hours. This way, the same consistent rules can be used for somebody dying in combat and somebody wasting away from a disease.


> ##### Story Tick
>
> A Story Tick is the unit of story time that passes in which all relevant PC's and NPC's get their actions in. The most obvious example is a round in combat, but it could also for instance be the time it takes to perform a short rest.

### Using items without proficiency
You have disadvantage on any attacks or skill checks using items you are not proficient in.


\page

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

# Stamina
Every character has an amount of maximum stamina based upon their aptitude and constitution. They can use this stamina for special actions. Some of these special actions every character can do, some are bound to specific sub classes. 

However, the more stamina you use up, the weaker you will feel. You will gain penalties if you drop below certain thresholds, see the following table.

| Stamina Threshold | Effect |
|:------:|:------:|
| <50%  | -1 on all skill checks. -1 on all saving throws |
| <25%  | -3 on all skill checks. -2 on all saving throws |
| 0% | -3 on all skill checks. -2 on all saving throws. Disadvantage on all checks. |

## Regaining Stamina
You regain up to 50% of your maximum stamina rounded up on a short rest. You regain full stamina on a long rest.

## Stamina moves


### Movement
Movement stamina moves cannot be performed whilst mounted.

#### Disengage -2 Stamina
You can spend 2 Stamina to be able to disengage as a bonus action.

#### Dash -2 Stamina
If you have not and will not use your action to dash this turn, you can spend 2 Stamina to be able to dash as a bonus action.

#### Standing Longjump -1 Stamina
By spending 1 Stamina you can double your jump distance for a **standing** longjump for this turn.

<div style='margin-top:340px'></div>

### Attacking

#### Shove -1 Stamina
When using a shove attack, you can spend 1 stamina to double the shove distance.

#### Pushing Attack -1 Stamina
When performing a basic melee attack on a creature of your size or smaller, you can spend 1 stamina to make it a pushing attack. If it hits, the target is not only dealt the damage of the blow, but is also pushed 5ft away from you.

#### Trip Attack -3 Stamina
When performing a basic attack on a creature of size Large or smaller, you can spend 3 stamina to make it a tripping attack. On a hit, the target makes a Physical Strength saving throw opposed by your DC. On a failed save, the target is knocked prone.

#### Jumping attack -1 Stamina
When performing a basic melee attack, you can spend 1 stamina to gain 5ft additional reach for that attack. You have disadvantage on this attack.

### Miscellaneous
#### Healing Surge -2 Stamina
As an action, you can spend a hit die and 2 stamina to gain half the value of the hit die + your Constitution  modifier.

#### Rally -2 Stamina
On your turn, you can use your bonus action and spend 2 stamina to bolster the resolve of one of your companions. When you do so, choose a creature that can see or hear you. That creature gains temporary hit points equal to your level + your Charisma modifier.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

# Death
Whilst in or near the Old Kingdom, there is a dimension other than the physical world named Death. The physical realm is named Life. The souls of all creatures that die will find themselves drawn into Death. Death is a wet and gloomy place with seven layers, each with more and faster flowing water, but less light. The water will seep your strength and willpower in order to incapacitate you and take you deeper into Death. Where the first layer consists of a tame stream and puddles, the fifth layer is a massive whirlpool, ever flowing and pulling you towards the seventh layer. Between each layer there are barriers named gates. These vary from a small waterfall to the before mentioned whirlpool. It is possible to return from Death, but the deeper you are in Death, the harder it is. Beyond the seventh layer and its gate, lies true death. It is unknown what this entails, but nothing has ever returned from there.

#### Your body whilst in Death
Whilst your soul is within Death, your body will be encased in ice, incapacitating your body. You cannot move, perform actions or reactions and cannot gain hit points. Any attack on your body will automatically hit, but cannot critically strike you. Your body will also automatically fail all Physical saving throws.

## Soul Decay
If your soul only spends a short period of time in Death and your body is still mostly intact, it is possible to return to your body without permanent effects. However, if your soul stays in Death for long periods of time on end, your soul will start to degrade. You will lose your personality traits and hunger more and more to taking the life of others. Eventually the hunger will overtake your senses and you will transform into one of the Dead. These are souls that simply refuse to stay dead and will seek ways of returning to Life.

Depending on your strength of will and your control of Free Magic, the decay will affect you differently. Most regular people will turn into mostly mindless beings simply named Dead. But a perished necromancer might turn into a Mordicant.

If a decayed soul somehow finds a way back to Life, its body will generally look withered and might have black mists leaking from various cracks. Being transformed into the Dead will have various benefits and disadvantages. Most Dead have inhuman strength and can survive most wounds. On the downside, most Dead can be bound by Free Magic and might require deaths to occur near them to remain in Life.


<div style='margin-top:240px'></div>

## Entering Death
There are various ways of entering Death, some forced, some voluntary. You always enter Death at the first layer, but the velocity of entering Death can be very different depending on the method of entry.

### Hitting 0 hit points
If a creature drops to 0 hit points, that creature's soul will enter Death. Every Story Tick the creature will potentially fall deeper into Death. If the creature passes the seventh layer of Death, the creature body will no longer be encased in ice and cannot return. Entering Death without any hit points makes it very likely that you will pass the seventh gate without outside help.

### Free magic
If you are a Free magic user, you will have natural connection with the Death dimension. Some free magic users can freely move into Death without being reduced to zero hit points. This will reduce the pull of the water, but will hardly make Death a safe space. The water can still drag you down and there could be Dead hunting you and trying to use you to return to Life.

### Artefacts
There are also artefacts that allow entrance to Death. The most common of these are the various bells magic users have, but there are also artefacts that do not require the user to have magical powers. This last category of artefact is very rare and sought after.


\page

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>


## Returning from Death
Once you enter Death and do not wish to pass the seventh gate, you will need to stabilize. This will be harder if your hit points at 0 and near impossible if your body and most specifically your brain are destroyed. If you have 0 hit points or worse, you will also be incapacitated in Death until you succeeded on your stabilisation saving throw. A stabilisation roll is considered a Death saving throw and will consist of a Charter Strength saving throw at the end of your turn. Upon success, you will stabilize, will no longer be incapacitated and stop your decent towards the seventh gate. Upon failure, you will go down one layer of Death, ever closer to true death.

##### Death stabilisation DC per layer
| Current Layer | Destroyed body | 0 Hit points | 1+ Hit points |
  |:----:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
  | 1  | Automatic Failure  |Automatic Failure  | Automatic Success |
  | 2  | Automatic Failure	|Automatic Failure  | 8  |
  | 3 | Automatic Failure 	|14  				| 10 |
  | 4 | 15 					|15  				| 12 |
  | 5 | 18 					|17  				| 14 |
  | 6 | 21 					|19  				| 16 |
  | 7 | 25 					|22  				| 18 |
  
### Descending Death Layers 
You can intentionally descend death layers by using your movement. You use your full movement to descend one layer. You can use a dash action to quickly descend another layer.

### Grappling creature in Death
If you are above 1 hit point, stabilized and you are on the same layer as another creature, you can attempt to grapple the creature. Distance to the target is irrelevant for this grapple check whilst these conditions are true. You will automatically succeed in grappling a stabilized willing creature. You have advantage on grappling a willing creature. Grappling a creature will stabilize them.

Whilst grappled, they will move with you, if you decide to either ascend or descend Death layers. You can grapple up to two creatures in Death, given they are both willing. The grappled creature can use its action to grant you advantage on climbing Death layers.

<div style='margin-top:240px'></div>

### Force creatures down
If you are above 1 hit point, stabilized and you are on the same layer as another creature, you can attempt to shove the creature through the next gate. Distance to the target is irrelevant for this shove check whilst these conditions are true. You must make a Strength + Aptitude skill check opposed by either a Strength + Aptitude skill check or an Agility + Aptitude skill check. The target has disadvantage if the creature is not considered stabilized. On success, the target creature is pushed one layer down, but will stay stabilized if it was before.



### Climbing Death layers
It is possible to claw back from Death back into life if you have a body to return to. Without a body, you will require help from either a necromancer or a creature with equivalent magical powers.

To climb a layer without magic, you will have to overcome not only the physical water flow of the gate but also its life draining properties. To climb a layer, you can use your action to make a Death saving throw. On success, you will climb one layer. If you climb from layer one up, you will return to Life and your body. The ice around your body will evaporate, but you will still feel the damp and cold of Death.
On a failure you will stay on your current layer. If you fail the DC by 5 or more or roll a one on the die, you will be dragged along with the water. You will no longer be considered stabilized and will immediately drop one layer. You do not get to make a Death stabilisation saving throw at the end of this turn.

##### Climbing Death layers DC
| Current Layer | 0 Hit points | 1+ Hit points |
  |:----:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
  | 1  | Automatic Success  | Automatic Success |
  | 2  | 12					| 8  |
  | 3 | 13				 	| 10 |
  | 4 | 14 					| 12 |
  | 5 | 16 					| 14 |
  | 6 | Automatic Failure 	| Automatic Failure |
  | 7 | Automatic Failure 	| Automatic Failure |

Creatures within 30 feet of you, but excluding you, are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures). Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell falls unconscious until the spell ends, the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. Subtract each creature’s hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature’s hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected. The ringer must make a DC Charter Intelligence saving save or also fall asleep. You can use your action to wake a sleeping person. |
| **Dyrim**  | 9-10 | Create a stationary reverberating echo originating from the ringer with a radius of 30ft. The echo will either decrease the DC of any Bell Magical effect by 3 + Spellslinger level for 1 minute or else removes an ongoing echo. Any concentration checks done within the echo by creatures other than the ringer are done at disadvantage.|

When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn't have a range of self, you can exert the spell to target a second creature in range with the same spell. To be eligible for Twinned Spell, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell's current level. This can be done in combination with existing exertion options on the spell, resulting in a four times higher stamina cost.

##### Sculpt Spell

When you cast a spell with a range that affects an area, you can expend 2 stamina to change the area's shape in one of the following ways:

- If the spell's range is a line, you can change it to a cone of half range.

Any ranged weapon attack that enters the wall’s space has disadvantage on the attack roll, and fire damage
is halved if the fire effect passes through the wall to reach its target. Spells or projectiles that deal cold damage that pass through the wall cause the area of the wall they pass through to freeze solid (at least a 5-foot square section is frozen).

While merged with the stone, you can’t see what occurs outside it, and any Wisdom (Perception) checks you make to hear sounds outside it are made with disadvantage. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while merged in the stone. You can use your movement to leave the stone where you entered it, which ends the spell.

Whenever your Thunderbolt and Fire claw ability hit a creature with a 16 or higher on the die roll, you can spend 1 stamina to turn this hit into a critical hit.

## Level 4

#### Cold Snap -1 Stamina
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet

On a failed saving throw, any affected creatures take 3d8 + Spellslinger level fire damage and are ignited for an additional 1d6 fire damage at the end of each of its turns.

<div style='margin-top:140px'></div>



## Level 6

The elements are your allies and not to be feared, but instead mastered. You gain resistance to the last elemental damage you have taken. So if you take fire damage, you will have Fire resistance for any further hits until you are hit by either Cold, Lightning or Thunder damage.

#### Subclasses
The Flesh Binder knows 3 subclasses which you choose one of at level 1. The available options are Occultist, Hemathurge or Animator.

<div class='wide'>
### Bells

Recharge die is d10. Each use of the bell is an action.

| Bell | Recharge | Effect |
|:----:|:---:|:|
| **Saraneth**  | 8-10 | Choose target Dead you can see within 60ft range. The target as well as any Dead within 5ft radius must make a Charter Charisma saving throw or be bound to your will. Dead already bound by another user will have advantage on this saving throw. See Keeper of the dead for additional information.|
| **Mosrael**  | 7-10 | **This bell only works in Death.** Choose a target on the same layer of Death. The target and any others within 10ft must make a Charter Charisma saving throw or be lifted one layer of Death up. Any affected creature can choose to fail the saving throw. The ringer is thrown one layer of Death down regardless of success. If any effected creatures either have 0 hit points or is classified as a Dead, the creature will have disadvantage on this saving throw.|
| **Belgaer**  | 9-10 | Choose a target within 20ft. You can make the target forget about an event of maximum 5 minutes if the target fails a Charter Intelligence saving throw. Or you can restore memory erased by a Belgaer bell. This will always restore all erased memories and cause the target to gain one level of exhaustion.|
| **Astarael**  | 10 | **This bell only works in Life.** All creatures within 40ft radius must make a Charter Strength saving throw. Dead creatures have disadvantage on this saving throw. Any creature who fails the saving throw is thrust 3 layers into Death. The ringer automatically fails the saving throw. |
</div>

### Keeper of the dead
Using the power of Saraneth, you can control Dead. There is a limit to how many Dead and how powerful Dead you can keep under your control for long periods. The Medium Dead are twice as hard to keep under control as Lesser Dead with the Greater Dead being twice as hard to keep under control as Medium Dead. You can use any combination of Dead you like. For example you can have two Lesser Dead and one Medium Dead or one Greater Dead or four Lesser Dead. 

The Dead have their own initiative, but follow your commands. Communicating commands to your Dead is done as a free action on your turn. The dead on their turn will try as best as they can to perform these commands. You can only change these commands on your turn. If you for instance tell a Dead to walk left and attack enemies there, but between your turn and the Dead's turn the enemies died, the Dead will still walk left.

You can only command Dead that are on the same plane of existence. For instance, if you step into Death, either willingly or forcedly, whilst you have Dead under your control remaining in Life, they will continue following their most recent commands. Any Dead you control in Death, you can give new commands to.

You can keep more Dead under your control for a short time, but once this time runs out, all the Dead under your control will break loose. The Lesser Dead will return to Death. Medium Dead must make a Charter Charisma saving throw, where on a failed saving throw they will return to Death. On a success, they will no longer be bound by you and cannot be bound for the next day. The Greater Dead will break from your bond.

As an action, you can spend a minute to banish a Dead under your control back to Death.

<div style='margin-top:20px'></div>

Consult the following table to find the maximum amount of Dead you can keep under control, what maximum challenge rating Dead you can keep and for how long you can maintain control after going over the maximum.

| Level | Maximum Lesser Dead | Maximum Challenge Rating Dead | Control Time while over Maximum |
|:----:|:-:|:-:|:---|
| 1-2  | 2  | 2 | 30 seconds |
| 3-4  | 4  | 3 | 2 minutes |
| 5-7  | 6  | 5 | 5 minutes |
| 8-10 | 10 | 6 | 10 minutes |

This corpse can be further manipulated using the Saraneth bell as an action, transforming the corpse into a Lesser Dead of Challenge rating 1 or lower under your control. This will put the Saraneth bell in recharge.

_Exert: Casting time becomes a bonus action. Corpse transformation into a Lesser Dead remains an action._

### Ability Score Improvement 

When you reach third level and again at 6th, 8th and 10th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

# Subclasses
The Flesh Binder knows 3 subclasses which you choose one of at level 1. The available options are Occultist, Hemathurge or Animator.

## Occultist
*The Damned stand ready*

#### Quick Build
You can make an Occultist quickly by following these suggestions. First, Aptitude should be your highest ability score, followed by Charisma. Second, choose the acolyte background. Third, choose the Charter saving throw defensive proficiency, picking at least Intelligence saving throw.

### Master of the Dead
You have advantage on any Death saving throws. You can also use the Mosrael bell as a bonus action.

### Profane Bloom
Whenever you or your minions bring an enemy down to 0 hp, roll a d10. On a 4 or higher, the enemy explodes. Any creature within 10 ft must make a Physical Agility saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a target takes 1d4 bludgeoning damage and 1d4 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful one. Allies automatically succeed on this saving throw. This effect can only trigger successfully once per turn.
This ability’s damage increases when you reach 3th level (1d6 + 1d6), 6th level (1d8 + 1d8), and 9th level (1d10 + 1d10).

#### Bone Wall -1 Stamina
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60ft
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Up to 1 minute

A non-magical wall composed of a wild assortment of bones springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of 3 5-foot-by-5-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other panel. 

If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (their choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.

The wall is an object made of bone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per panel. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the GM’s discretion. The wall disappears when the spell ends.

_Exert: 4 panels with 40 hit points per panel._

<div style='margin-top:240px'></div>

#### Growing pains -2 Stamina

The spell’s bludgeoning damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 3th level (3d8), 6th level (4d8), and 9th level (5d8).

The target or a creature within 5 ft of it can use its action to douse the flame. The ignite damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 3th level (2d6), 6th level (3d6), and 9th level (4d6)._

The target takes half damage on a successful saving throw. Since the force of this projectile is mystical as well as physical it can pass through one opponent and carry on to the next, rending and tearing through whatever is in its path. The spear will only be stopped by at least 2 feet of stone, 3 inch of common metal, or 5 feet of wood blocks.

## Animator

 *Mold your own friend* 

#### Quick Build
You can make an Animator quickly by following these suggestions. First, Constitution should be your highest ability score, followed by Aptitude. Second, choose the hermit background.  Third, choose the Charter saving throw defensive proficiency, picking at least Charisma and Intelligence saving throws.

### Mordicant
  The Animator can create their own Dead by using Free Magic. The Mordicant has a set of base stats and actions, which can be expanded depending on your Flesh Binder level. The Animator can then makes adaptations to the Mordicant, which can be found in the Mordicant Adaptation table. Every adaptation will require a certain amount of adaptation points, depending on how extensive the change is. To change a Mordicant, or to return it from Death, you require a corpse of a humanoid non-Dead that died within the past week. 
  
  A Mordicant counts as a Greater Dead towards your maximum amount of Dead, but will never break free of your control for being over your maximum number of Dead controlled. If the Mordicant is bound by another creature than you, the Mordicant will simply not move or attack until it is returned to your side. Consult the following table to find how many adaptation points you have at specific levels. 


| Level | Adaptation Points | Mordicant AC | Mordicant Hit Points | Mordicant Str |
|:----:|:---:			|:---:		|:---:				|:---:|
| 1-2  | 4 				| 14 		| 63 				| 15(+2) |
| 3-5  | 6				| 15 		| 80 				| 17(+3) |
| 6-7  | 9 				| 16 		| 100 				| 19(+4) |
| 8-10 | 12 			| 17 		| 130 				| 22(+6) |

<div style='margin-top:40px'></div>

#### Soul Bond
To create the Mordicant, you have bonded your soul to your Mordicant and are able to control the Mordicant even if you are considered unconscious or if you are in Death. Due to this soul bond, if your Mordicant dies, you get 40% of his hp as Psychic damage rounded down. The Mordicant has its own initiative but follows your commands.

The next attack roll made against this target before the end of your next turn has advantage, due to some distraction. The target also has disadvantage on its next saving throw before the start of your next turn.

The GM will determine the distraction, depending on the location of the scene. Examples of distractions are random flashes of light, unfortunate wardrobe malfunctions, a shiny marble on the ground, an ice pail sliding down the targets collar or a loudly protesting stomach.

#### Hand of the seer -4 Stamina
___

- **Range:** 120ft
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a Large hand of shimmering, translucent force in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. This hand will assist you in making any prophecies you make, a reality. The hand lasts for the spell’s duration, and it moves at your command, mimicking the movements of your own hand.

The hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your hit point maximum. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. It has a Strength of 26 (+8) and a Dexterity of 10 (+0). The hand doesn’t fill its space.

When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following effects with it.

- Clenched Fist. The hand strikes one creature or object within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for the hand using your game statistics. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 force damage.
- Forceful Hand. The hand attempts to push a creature within 5 feet of it in a direction you choose. Make a check with the hand’s Strength contested by the Strength check of the target. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your intelligence modifier. The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it.
- Grasping Hand. The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand’s Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. While the hand is grappling the target, you can use a bonus action to have the hand crush it. When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your spell casting ability modifier.
- Interposing Hand. The hand interposes itself between you and a creature you choose until you give the hand a different command. The hand moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with half cover against the target. The target can’t move through the hand’s space if its Strength score is less than or equal to the hand’s Strength score. If its Strength score is higher than the hand’s Strength score, the target can move toward you through the hand’s space, but that space is difficult terrain for the target.

This spell’s clenched fist option damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 6th level (5d8), 8th level (6d8), and 10th level (7d8).

This spell’s grasping hand option damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 6th level (3d6), 8th level (4d6), and 10th level (5d6).

### Rapid Prototyping
As an action, you can build a variety of prototype constructs. Each of these has their own uses and special quirks, but also share a few characteristics. None of your prototypes are built to last or could be considered reliable, nor can you resist putting in a way to move them. 

Each prototype costs some stamina to create and has its own statistics block. Each prototype takes its turn right after yours, in the order of their remaining duration, starting with the prototype with the most duration. 

You also have the following actions with which you can interact with your prototypes:

- As a bonus action, you can move an active prototype under your control up to 30 feet.
- As an action, you can fix a prototype, resetting its duration and restoring 2d4 + 2 x Mysticist level hit points.
- If the duration of a prototype expires, they are no longer considered magical and stop functioning. They do still occupy their location and their location is considered difficult terrain (given the prototype is of size small or larger). 
- As an action, you can reactivate a broken prototype without spending the material components, but respending the stamina. This can only be done if their location is unoccupied.

There is a limit to how many prototypes you can have under your control, which can be found in the table below.

## Ammunition Modifications
Any costs listed are on top of the cost of the ammunition. Modifications can only be made to ammunition with the approval of the GM, to prevent things such as barbed trebuchet shots.

All damage listed is in addition to any regular damage the ammunition would deal on hit.

#### Barbed
Barbed ammunition will stick in the target on hit. If the target takes further damage, it must make a DC 10 Physical Agility saving throw or the barbed ammunition will be ripped out, dealing 1d6 piercing damage. The target or a creature within 5 ft of it can use its action to remove the ammunition.

<div style='margin-top:140px'></div>
```
```
#### Charter 
Charter enchanted ammunition can be activated using a free action by any creature wielding the ammunition and that is capable of charter magic. Charter ammunition is counted as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks and damage.

## Poisons

### Poison Types
Poisons come in the following four types:


- #### Contact: 
Contact poison can be smeared on an object and remains potent until it is Touched or washed off. A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its Effects.

- #### Ingested:
A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its Effects. The dose can be delivered in food or a liquid. You may decide that a partial dose has a reduced Effect, such as allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a failed save.

- #### Inhaled: 
These poisons are powders or gases that take Effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot cube to its Effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately afterward. Holding one’s breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.

- #### Injury:
Injury poison can be applied to Weapons, Ammunition, trap Components, and other Objects that deal piercing or slashing damage and remain potent until delivered through a wound or washed off. A creature that takes piercing or slashing damage from an object coated with the poison is exposed to its Effects.
